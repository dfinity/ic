= Ubuntu base OS development

The Ubuntu-based Boundary Node OS is built similar to the IC OS we still recap the
necessary steps:

* creating a root filesystem image using docker -- this is based on the
  official Ubuntu docker image and simply adds the OS kernel plus our
  required services to it

* converting this root filesystem into filesystem images for `/` and `/boot`
  via `mke2fs` (`make_ext4fs`)

The build instructions in the Dockerfile define the actual process.

The following template directories are simply copied verbatim onto the target
system:

* `etc`
* `opt`
* `boot`
* `var` (temporarily)

If you need to add files to the system, simply drop them into the
appropriate target directory. At present, all dfinity-specific binaries
and scripts go to `opt/ic/bin`.

If you install new systemd services, drop an appropriate unit file into
`etc/systemd/system` and add an activation to the Dockerfile.

Various more detailed implementation aspects of the system are documented
below.

== Dynamic file system mounts

Currently, dynamic file system mounts for the Boundary Node OS are only prepared
but not used. See additional details in the IC OS documentation. For now
the following mapping is fixed.

* A: `/dev/vda4` -> `/boot`, `/dev/vda5` -> `/` and `/dev/vda6` -> `/var`

== First boot actions

Several preparatory operations are performed when the system boots for the
first time. This documents what actions are performed presently and might
serve as a guide on how to add further actions.

=== ssh key generation

The `setup-ssh-keys` (and corresponding shell script) service performs one of
two things: If this is the first boot ever (on a newly installed system), it
generates ssh keys and stashes them away in a location that is preserved across
reboots and in the future upgrades.

=== Boundary node bootstrap

The `bootstrap-ic-node` service (and its corresponding) shell script performs
customization of the installation using node-specific information. This includes:

* network environment: `network.conf` (more details below)
* essential information about the IC: `nns.conf`

For all of mentioned parameters, the system expects a file `ic-bootstrap.tar` supplied on a removable storage medium (e.g.
a USB stick or an optical medium).

==== Network configuration

The network configuration is performed using a file `network.conf` in the
bootstrap tarball. It must contain lines of "key=value" statements,
with the following keys supported:

* `ipv6_address`: address used for the IC replica service
* `ipv6_gateway`: gateway used for the primary interface
* `name_servers`: space-separated list of DNS servers
* TODO: BOUN-180 ipv4_address

This configuration file is simply copied to the `config` partition and evaluated
on each boot to set up network.
