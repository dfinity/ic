# Uncomment this to run system with SELinux in PERMISSIVE mode:
# the system will use SELinux and keep track of operations that would
# be prohibited, but will only log but not actually deny them. This is
# useful for debug and policy development. The system behaves essentially the
# same as if SELinux was not activated.

#EXTRA_BOOT_ARGS="security=selinux selinux=1 enforcing=0"

# Uncomment this to run system with SELinux in ENFORCING mode: All rules
# of the policy are enforced, and forbidden actions are not just logged but
# stopped. This causes the system to behave differently than in either
# "no SELinux" or "permissive" mode.
