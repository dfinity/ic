# Rate limiting based on fields in the CBOR.
# Note: Some rate limits are defined in nginx_global.conf.  This CBOR rate limit relies on the CBOR contents variable
#       defined in the server section below, so the rate limit is defined locally.
# Note: We MAY want to define the identity canister ID in ansible.
#       Disadvantage:  Increased indirection.
#       Advantage:  It is changed in one place.
#       Disadvantage:  Ansible does not derive values from the Rust code, where the identity canister originates, so
#                      if the identity changes, Ansible will not help by automatically updating this value.
#       Evaluation of advantage: At present this ID is used in one place in ansible.
#       At present the disadvantages outweigh the advantage, so we keep the value here.
