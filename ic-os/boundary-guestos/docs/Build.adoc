= IC Boundary Node Guest OS build

The Ubuntu-based Boundary Node Guest OS is built by (equivalent to IC gues OS):

* constructing the system using docker -- this is based on the official Ubuntu docker
  image and adds the OS kernel plus our required services to it

* converting this into filesystem images for `/` and `/boot`
  via `make_ext4fs`

* separately building the `efi` and `grub` partitions

* putting everything together into a pre-partitioned disk image with a layout
  suitable for A/B system upgrades

The entire disk image is built using bazel:

----
gitlab-ci/container/container-run.sh
bazel build //ic-os/boundary-guestos/envs/prod
----

It allows to build `prod` and `dev` images. The `dev` images use the local service
worker from the branch and allow for console access using the username `root` and
the password `root`.

See notes below on the individual build steps.

== Constructing the system using docker

All build instructions are contained in `context/Dockerfile`.

The following template directories are simply copied verbatim onto the target
system:

* `etc`
* `opt`
* `boot`
* `vat` (temporary - will be made obsolete)

Additional files can be deployed by dropping them into the appropriate target
location before the build. All IC binaries are installed into `/opt/ic/bin`.
Unit files for additional systemd services are to be dropped into `/etc/systemd/system`,
all units found there will be activated as part of the build.

The final docker image is extracted using `docker save` at the end of this process.

== Building filesystem images

Two filesystem images are built for each logical OS install, the `boot` and
`root` filesystems. `boot` will hold the contents of everything below
`/boot` from the previous build stage (this is essentially the kernel,
initrd and some extra boot arguments), while `root` holds everything below
`/` except for the contents of `/boot`. This split is to enable verified
boot for confidential VMs later on. See for more link:../../guestos/docs/Build.adoc#building-filesystem-images[information]

Both `boot` and `root` filesystem images are built using `make_ext4fs`. This
allows constructing the filesystems in a bit-by-bit deterministic fashion,
also squashing all timestamps (that are invariably non-deterministic by
docker).

== Bootloader build

See for more link:../../guestos/docs/Build.adoc#bootloader-build[information]

== Disk image build

The final disk image is built by setting up a partition table and transferring
the individually built filesystem images into their respective partitions.
The layout of the partition table is described in `scripts/partitions.csv`.
