= Boundary Node Guest OS Components

The Boundary Node has a number of specific components:

- `ic-gateway` is used to proxy HTTP calls to `ic-boundary` using IC protocol
- `ic-boundary` forwards the IC requests to replicas

== Socks proxy
- A SOCKS proxy will be running on port 1443 and 1080 on the boundary nodes,
 only accessible from IPv6 netblock addresses.
- The 1443 listener is stunnel4 configured as a SSL->TCP proxy to the dante service running on localhost:9898.
- The 1080 listener is configured for TCP proxy to the dante service,
- The dante service is configured to allow outbound IPv4 TCP connections to any TCP port.
- Replica nodes can use the Boundary node SOCKS proxy for IPv4 connections
- Replica -> IPv6:1443 -> Stunnel4 -> localhost:9898 -> Dante -> IPv4 -> Internet (TLS)
- Replica -> IPv6:1080 -> Dante -> IPv4 -> Internet (non TLS)
- Firewall rules are set such that connections are allowed from IPv6 netblock addresses on IPv6 ports 1443 and 1080.
