# Network Configuration File
#
# Update these settings according to your specific network and node requirements.

# ------------------------------
# IPv6 Settings (required)
# ------------------------------
# Update the following IPv6 settings as per your network configuration.
#
# Define the network part of your IPv6 address:
ipv6_prefix=2a00:fb01:400:44
#
# Define the gateway address for your IPv6 network. Ensure it's within your network range:
ipv6_gateway=2a00:fb01:400:44::1

# ------------------------------
# Node Reward Settings (Required for the ICP Mainnet)
# -----------------------------
#
# Defines the node reward type that the operator expects for this node.
# The value must correspond to a community-approved type and operator configuration in the NNS.
# See https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Deployment_config.ini#node_reward_type_Documentation for more info.
#
# To find the rewardable node types for the node operator, run:
# ic-admin --nns-url https://ic0.app get-node-operator <operator-id>
#
# node_reward_type=type3.1

# ------------------------------
# IPv4 Settings (Optional)
# ------------------------------
# Uncomment and define the IPv4 settings for each node with a dedicated IPv4 address on your network, if applicable.
# See https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Networking_Guide for more info.
#
# Define the IPv4 address for your node:
# ipv4_address=212.71.124.178
#
# Define the subnet mask using the prefix length. Note that the ipv4_prefix_length should NOT have a slash (/):
# ipv4_prefix_length=28
#
# Define the IPv4 gateway. Ensure it's reachable from the provided IPv4 address:
# ipv4_gateway=212.71.124.177


# ----------------------------------
# Domain Name (only required with IPv4)
# ----------------------------------
# Define the domain name for your node. Ensure proper configuration of A and AAAA records for this domain.
# domain=node1.example.com

# ----------------------------------
# Trusted Execution
# ----------------------------------
# Trusted execution is a experimental feature providing an extra layer of security. The feature is under development
# and should only be enabled on select nodes. Do not change without prior instruction.
# enable_trusted_execution_environment=true
#

# ----------------------------------
# Beta node registration
# ----------------------------------
# This flag is used to allow a node to use a new node deployment mechanism that doesn't require the node operator
# private key to be in the node during deployment. The feature is under development.
# enable_beta_node_registration=true
#

#
# ----------------------------------
# Verbose flag
# ----------------------------------
# Verbose flag is used to log GuestOS console logs to the Host terminal. Only uncomment if directed to by the Troubleshooting Node Deployment Errors wiki page
# verbose=true
