# Update these settings according to your specific network and node requirements.

# ------------------------------
# Node Reward Settings (required)
# ------------------------------
# Specifies the type of node rewards that the node operator expects to receive.
# The value must match a community-approved value in the NNS.
#
# Example command to get node operator details:
# ic-admin --nns-url https://ic0.app get-node-operator ut325-qbq5v-fli2f-e2a5h-qapdd-fsuyv-xej2j-ogvux-i3fc2-5nj3a-2ae
# Example output:
# NodeOperator { node_operator_principal_id: ut325-qbq5v-fli2f-e2a5h-qapdd-fsuyv-xej2j-ogvux-i3fc2-5nj3a-2ae, node_allowance: 0, node_provider_principal_id: lq5ra-f4ibl-t7wpy-hennc-m4eb7-tnfxe-eorgd-onpsl-wervo-7chjj-6qe, dc_id: "bo1", rewardable_nodes: {"type1": 28}, ipv6: None }
# ==> The community-approved value of node_reward_type is "type1"
#
# If not provided, the NNS will attempt to assign a value based on the operator's reward configuration.
# However, if the reward configuration in the NNS is ambiguous, the NNS will return an error.
# For instance, if the operator has both "type3" and "type3.1" rewards, the NNS will return an error if
# the node_reward_type is not provided.
# Expected value format:
# node_reward_type=typeX or node_reward_type=typeX.Y
# Examples include "type3.1", "type1", etc.:
# node_reward_type=type3.1

# ------------------------------
# IPv6 Settings (required)
# ------------------------------
# Update the following IPv6 settings as per your network configuration.
#
# Define the network part of your IPv6 address:
ipv6_prefix=2a00:fb01:400:44
#
# Define the gateway address for your IPv6 network. Ensure it's within your network range:
ipv6_gateway=2a00:fb01:400:44::1


# ------------------------------
# IPv4 Settings (Optional)
# ------------------------------
# Uncomment and define the IPv4 settings for each node with a dedicated IPv4 address on your network, if applicable.
# See https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Node_Provider_Networking_Guide for more info.
#
# Define the IPv4 address for your node:
# ipv4_address=212.71.124.178
#
# Define the subnet mask using the prefix length. Note that the ipv4_prefix_length should NOT have a slash (/):
# ipv4_prefix_length=28
#
# Define the IPv4 gateway. Ensure it's reachable from the provided IPv4 address:
# ipv4_gateway=212.71.124.177


# ----------------------------------
# Domain Name (only required with IPv4)
# ----------------------------------
# Define the domain name for your node. Ensure proper configuration of A and AAAA records for this domain.
# domain=node1.example.com

# ----------------------------------
# Verbose flag
# ----------------------------------
# Verbose flag is used to log GuestOS console logs to the Host terminal. Only uncomment if directed to by the Troubleshooting Node Deployment Errors wiki page
# verbose=true
