= IC-OS

== Introduction

IC-OS is an umbrella term for all the operating systems within the IC, including SetupOS, HostOS, GuestOS, and Boundary-guestOS.

* SetupOS: Responsible for booting a new replica node and installing HostOS and GuestOS.
* HostOS: The operating system that runs on the host machine. Its main responsibility is to launch and run the GuestOS in a virtual machine. In terms of its capabilities, it is intentionally limited by design to not perform any trusted capabilities.
* GuestOS: The operating system that runs inside a virtual machine on the HostOS. The core IC protocol is executed within the GuestOS.
* Boundary-GuestOS: The operating system that runs on boundary nodes. It contains all the services necessary to fulfill the two main tasks of the boundary nodes: (1) route ICP API requests to a healthy replica of the right subnet (`ic-boundary`); and (2) translate HTTP requests into ICP API requests to allow direct access to dapps from the browser (`icx-proxy`).

== Managing IC-OS files

For details on adding to and removing files from IC-OS builds, refer to the link:rootfs/README.adoc#[rootfs/ documentation]

== Building IC-OS images

All the IC-OS images can be built though Bazel.

=== Environment setup

Building IC-OS images locally requires environment configuration. The required packages are found in ic/gitlab-ci/container/Dockerfile.

In addition to these packages, https://bazel.build/install[Bazel] must be installed.

As an alternative, the following script can be used to build the images in a container with the correct environment already configured:

    ./gitlab-ci/container/container-run.sh

=== Build targets

Each image has its own build targets, which are variations of the image:

* SetupOS: `prod`, `dev`
* HostOS: `prod`, `dev`
* GuestOS: `prod`, `dev`, `dev-malicious`
* BoundaryGuestOS: `prod`, `dev`

The difference between production and development images is that the console can be accessed on `dev` images, but not on `prod` images.

Note: The username and password for all IC-OS `dev` images are set to `root`

=== Building images

Use the following command to build images:

   $ bazel build //ic-os/{setupos,hostos,guestos,boundary-guestos}/envs/<TARGET>/...

All IC-OS image build outputs are stored under `/ic/bazel-bin/ic-os/{setupos,hostos,guestos,boundary-guestos}/envs/<TARGET>`

Example:

   $ bazel build //ic-os/guestos/envs/dev/...
   # This will output a GuestOS image in /ic/bazel-bin/ic-os/guestos/envs/dev

== Under the hood: Building an image

IC-OS images are first created as docker images and then transformed into "bare-metal" or "virtual-metal" images that can be used outside containerization.

Rather than installing and relying on a full-blown upstream ISO image, the system is assembled based on a minimal Docker image with the required components added. This approach allows for a minimal, controlled, and well understood system - which is key for a secure platform.

The build process is as follows:

=== Docker

The docker build process is split into two dockerfiles. This split is necessary to ensure a reproducible build.

*Dockerfile.base*

  ic/ic-os/{setupos,hostos,guestos,boundary-guestos}/context/Dockerfile.base

   ** The Dockerfile.base takes care of installing all upstream Ubuntu packages.
   ** Because the versions of these packages can change at any given time (as updates are published regularly), in order to maintain build determinism, once a week, the CI pipeline builds a new base image for each OS. The result is published on the DFINITY public https://hub.docker.com/u/dfinity[Docker Hub].

*Dockerfile*

  ic/ic-os/{setupos,hostos,guestos,boundary-guestos}/context/Dockerfile

   ** The +Dockerfile+ builds off the published base image and takes care of configuring and assembling the main disk-image.
   ** Any instruction in this file needs to be reproducible in itself.

=== Image Transformation

The docker image is then transformed into a bootable "bare-metal" or "virtual-metal" VM image for use outside containerization (either in a VM or as a physical host operating system). The resulting image is minimal, with only a few systemd services running.

Note that all pre-configuration of the system is performed using docker utilities, and the system is actually also operational as a docker container.
This means that some development and testing could be done on the docker image itself, but an actual VM image is still required for proper testing.

== IC-OS Directory Organization

* *rootfs/*: This directory contains scripts and components that are copied to the target IC-OS.
** For instructions on how to make changes to the OS, refer to the link:rootfs/README.adoc#[rootfs/ documentation]

* *bootloader/*: This directory contains everything related to building EFI firmware and the GRUB bootloader image. 

* *scripts/*: This directory contains build and utility scripts for the IC-OS.

== Adding a new dependency to an IC-OS image

To add a new package to an IC-OS image you need to:

   * Update the list of packages to install in `ic/ic-os/{setupos,hostos,guestos,boundary-guestos}/context/packages.common`
   ** Commit the changes and wait for CI to publish the base image
   * Update the base image hash in `ic/ic-os/{setupos,hostos,guestos,boundary-guestos}/context/docker-base.<env>`
