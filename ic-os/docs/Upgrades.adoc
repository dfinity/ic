= Upgrades

Both HostOS and GuestOS can be upgraded.

[NOTE]
GuestOS upgrades are often referred to as "Replica upgrades." While these upgrades indeed update the replica, they also upgrade all other GuestOS services.

The disk layout for both the HostOS and GuestOS includes two sets of system partitions, partition sets "A" and "B". This A/B partitioning enables a dual-boot system that can be updated and maintained without any downtime.

At any given moment, one partition set is "active", and the other is "passive".

*The GuestOS upgrade process is as follows:*

* The GuestOS Update image is written to the passive partition set. 
* The active and passive partition sets are "swapped," (i.e. the active partition set becomes "passive," and the passive partition set becomes "active")
* GuestOS reboots. After reboot, GuestOS will use the new GuestOS version on the newly active partition set, thereby upgrading the GuestOS.

The same process is followed for HostOS upgrades.

=== Building upgrade image

The Bazel command used to build the HostOS/GuestOS images also generates a HostOS/GuestOS upgrade image:

    $ bazel build //ic-os/{hostos,guestos}/envs/<TARGET>/...

This command will output `update-img.tar{.gz,.zst}` in `/ic/bazel-bin/ic-os/{hostos,guestos}/envs/{prod,dev,dev-malicious}`, which is the tar archive of the HostOS/GuestOS update image.

Note that the upgrade images include only the boot and root partitions in a tar archive. Full images, on the other hand, include the entire partition table.

=== Installing upgrade image

Each HostOS/GuestOS rootfs folder contains the manageboot script, used to install the upgrade image:

    manageboot.sh upgrade-install update-img.tar
    manageboot.sh upgrade-commit

Following the execution of these commands, the system will reboot into the newly installed version. Note that unless confirmation of full operational functionality is provided, the system will rollback to the previous HostOS/GuestOS on the subsequent reboot:

    manageboot.sh confirm
