= Configuration

Each IC-OS has a 100 MB config partition. All IC-OS config partitions are initialized to be empty, except for SetupOS.

In production, configuration is propagated from a partition on the USB installer through each of SetupOS, HostOS and GuestOS:

* SetupOS reads and validates its configuration files from `/config/`
* SetupOS copies its configuration files from `/config/` to `/var/ic/config/`
* SetupOS copies its configuration files from `/var/ic/config/` to the HostOS config partition.
* HostOS reads the configuration files from `/boot/config`. These files are used to populate the GuestOS config partition through a more complicated process described below.

== Detailed configuration steps

=== SetupOS -> HostOS

SetupOS validates, sanitizes, and copies all of its configuration files to the HostOS config partition. Refer to link:../rootfs/setupos/opt/ic/bin/config.sh[config.sh] link:../rootfs/setupos/opt/ic/bin/devices.sh[devices.sh]

=== HostOS -> GuestOS

HostOS builds the "bootstrap config image". Refer to link:../scripts/build-bootstrap-config-image.sh[build-bootstrap-config-image.sh]

The bootstrap config image contains a tar file with the GuestOS configuration files.
When the HostOS launches the GuestOS, the bootstrap config image is attached to the GuestOS as a virtual USB. Refer to link:../rootfs/hostos-scripts/guestos/guestos.xml.template[guestos.xml.template]

When the GuestOS boots, it checks for available removable media devices (i.e. the bootstrap config image). If such a device is found, the media must contain a VFAT filesystem and a single file called `ic-bootstrap.tar`.

GuestOS then reads from `ic-bootstrap.tar` (link:../rootfs/guestos/opt/ic/bin/bootstrap-ic-node.sh[see bootstrap-ic-node.sh]), and the contents are unpacked and distributed in one of two places:

* *System state:* Node initialization material (initial registry & keys) is copied directly into target directories for replica use.
* *Config partition:* All other contents of the injected config are copied into the `/boot/config` directory. These configurations need to be available on subsequent boots (not just the first boot of the system), and need to be preserved across upgrades.
** The contents of `/boot/config` are then used in various ways to parameterize system services as they start. For example, ssh keys are installed to target accounts, network settings are applied by network set-up scripts, etc.
** For the IC, the `generate-replica-config.sh` script uses the `ic.json5.template` file to produce the configuration required by the replica (also cf. service file definition). Template placeholders are populated with information from `/boot/config` and elsewhere.

[NOTE]
GuestOS only reads a predefined set of files from the bootstrap config image (i.e., it "sanitizes" the bootstrap config image).

[NOTE]
The reason for the bootstrap config image redirection is to ensure that GuestOS maintains control over what goes onto its config partition. Theoretically, a malicious Node Technician could modify their HostOS image and place any file onto the bootstrap config image. However, GuestOS will only copy a predefined set of files to its config partition.

== Implementation notes

=== Guidance for adding configuration bits

To add a new configuration file/directory:

1. Add handling to `build-bootstrap-config-image.sh` to include the new file/directory in the bootstrap config image.

2. Add handling to `bootstrap-ic-node.sh` for the new file/directory.

3. Add interpretation of configuration file/directory to suitable place, e.g. generate-replica-config.sh

4. Adapt testnet and/or prod deployment config as needed
** E.g. for testnets, you may need to update link:../../testnet/tools/icos_deploy.sh[icos_deploy.sh]. If you are adding a production deployment config file, you may need to add a file to the SetupOS config partition to be piped through to HostOS.

*Values and defaults*: Please ensure that the system is operational even in the absence of specific configuration bits, and fall back to sane production defaults. Already deployed nodes will by definition lack new configuration variables and need to behave properly. And defaults unsuitable for tests need to be overridden in tests (not the other way around).

*Format*: The configuration files are "free-form". In principle, any format will work. But please use simple formats (e.g. files containing key=value pair lines). Parsing is done inside shell scripts and safely parsing "fancy" formats may be tricky.
Consider that values may be controlled by an attacker on boot. Bootstrapping a node with bogus values can cause the node to malfunction. Our security goal is to disallow an Node Technician to gain control over the node via code injection or similar.

*Configuration files*: New configuration bits might be added to either existing configuration files that have a suitable structure (e.g. key=value pairs), or new files. If in doubt, opt for adding additional configuration files.

*Interpretation of configuration bits*: Any script or service in the system may pull configuration bits out of /boot/config to customize its behavior. E.g. if adding parameter-driven customization of ic.json5, then augment the generate-replica-config.sh script to pull the configuration values and substitute them into the generated configuration.

*Documentation*: Please keep documentation up-to-date (link:ConfigStore-SetupOSHostOS.adoc[SetupOS/HostOS config store], link:../guestos/docs/ConfigStore.adoc[GuestOS config store])

=== Testing

* *bootstrap-ic-node.sh* can be temporarily tweaked (internally adapt paths, then run the process_bootstrap function):
** run stand-alone
** verify that the config image is unpacked
** verify its files are in the correct locations

* *bootstrap-ic-node.sh* can be temporarily tweaked (internally adapt paths; basically just running the process_bootstrap function of it) to run stand-alone and verify that the config image is unpacked and its files sorted into the correct locations.

* *generate-replica-config.sh* can be run stand-alone to verify that it produces the intended ic.json5 configuration from the template.

After all is done, it is advised to prepare a configuration for a single node and boot it in a VM before conducting testnet deployments.
