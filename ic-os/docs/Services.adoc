== Packages

We use Focal (20.04) package repositories for our Ubuntu packages.
To see the full list of packages included in each IC-OS, refer to the context/packages.common file in each respective OS.

== Services

In addition to the regular, built-in Ubuntu services, a unique set of systemd services are added or managed for each IC-OS. Some services are enabled in context/Dockerfile, and custom services are defined at etc/systemd/services.

The specific systemd services for each IC-OS are as follows:

[NOTE]
These lists may be out-of-date. For the source of truth, see each OSes `context/Dockerfile` and `etc/systemd`.
