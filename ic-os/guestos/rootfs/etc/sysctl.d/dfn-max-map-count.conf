# We need to increase vm.max_map_count to accommodate for canisters with large states. 
# Canister memory can become fragmented over period of time because of multitudes of 
# reasons including intentionally malicious access patterns. 
# While using such fragmented memory, we might hit the per process limit 
# (vm.max_map_count) of number of memory mapping regions that can be managed.
# Hence this needs to be increased. Not doing so can lead to 
# exhaustion of vmas and no_memory errors.
