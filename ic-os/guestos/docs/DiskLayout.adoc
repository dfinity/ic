= GuestOS disk layout

The (virtual) disk of the IC GuestOS is structured to allow
system upgrades with A/B partition switching (see
link:Upgrades{outfilesuffix}[upgrades]) while ensuring system
integrity and confidentiality for secure VMs.

The partition structure is as follows:

- +/dev/vda1+ *esp*: (EFI system partition)
- +/dev/vda2+ *grub* Grub bootloader modules and config
- +/dev/vda3+ *config* System config store
- +/dev/vda4+ *A_boot* Boot partition for system A
- +/dev/vda5+ *A_root* Root partition for system A
- +/dev/vda6+ *A_var* Mutable data partition for system A
- +/dev/vda7+ *B_boot* Boot partition for system B
- +/dev/vda8+ *B_root* Root partition for system B
- +/dev/vda9+ *B_var* Mutable data partition for system B
- +/dev/vda10+ *store* Encrypted LVM for payload data

== *esp*: EFI system partition

This contains the primary grub bootloader itself in
+EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi+. Nothing else is on this partition.
This bootloader is supposed to be signed and recognised by
EFI firmware for tamper-resistance.

== *grub*: Grub bootloader and configuration

Contains essential grub modules below +/boot/grub/x86_64-efi+
as well as the (static) +grub.cfg+ and the (dynamic) +grubenv+.

The +grubenv+ file will at times be written by either grub
or the booted operating system, to coordinate on partition
switching during system upgrades.

All other files in this partition are immutable (and to be
signed for verification by grub in order to prevent
tampering).

== *config* System config store

Contains the config store persisted across system upgrades.
See link:ConfigStore{outfilesuffix}[config store] for a
specification of its contents.

== *A_boot* / *B_boot* Boot partition for system A/B

Contains the linux kernel to be booted as +vmlinuz+,
optionally a file +extra_boot_args+ that sets additional
arguments to boot the kernel with, and a file +initrd.img+
that is to be loaded as initial ram disk.

Contents of the inactive partition are replaced on system
upgrades, all files contained in here are supposed to
be signed (and signature verified by grub) in order to
prevent tampering.

== *A_root* / *B_root* Root partition for system A/B

This partition is to be used as the root file system for
the booted system. Generally it is an (immutable) ext4
filesystem, it should be set up using integrity
protection via +dm-verity+ by the initial ram disk
to prevent tampering.

== *A_var* / *B_var* Mutable data partition for system A/B

This partition is used as mutable +/var+ filesystem for
the OS. It is set up as encrypted block device such that
it is both confidentiality and integrity protected.
It is wiped on system upgrades but will otherwise persist
across reboots.

== *store* Encrypted LVM for payload data

Set up as an encrypted block device to hold multiple
logical volumes containing the IC payload data. This
partition does not exist yet in the initially _built_ and
_deployed_ disk image. It will be created by the system
on first boot.
