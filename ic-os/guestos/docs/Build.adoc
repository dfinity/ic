= IC guest OS build

The Ubuntu-based IC OS is built by:

* constructing the system using docker -- this is based on the official Ubuntu docker
  image and simply adds the OS kernel plus our required services to it

* converting this into filesystem images for +/+ and +/boot+
  via +make_ext4fs+

* separately building the +efi+ and +grub+ partitions

* putting everything together into a pre-partitioned disk image with a layout
  suitable for A/B system upgrades

The entire disk image can be built using the following command:

----
bazel build //ic-os/guestos/envs/prod/...
----

"prod" can be replaced with "dev" for the dev variant. The built image can be
found at `/ic/bazel-bin/ic-os/guestos/envs/prod/disk-img.tar{.gz,.zst}`

See notes below on the individual build steps.

== Constructing the system using docker

All build instructions are contained in +context/Dockerfile+.

The following template directories are copied verbatim onto the target
system:

* +etc+
* +opt+
* +boot+

Additional files can be deployed by dropping them into the appropriate target
location before the build. All IC binaries are installed into +/opt/ic/bin+.
Unit files for additional systemd services are to be dropped into +/etc/systemd/system+,
all units found there will be activated as part of the build.

The final docker image is extracted using +docker save+ at the end of this process.

== Building filesystem images

Two filesystem images are built for each logical OS install, the "+boot+" and
"+root+" filesystems. "+boot+" will hold the contents of everything below
"+/boot+" from the previous build stage (this is essentially the kernel,
initrd and some extra boot arguments), while "+root+" holds everything below
"+/+" except for the contents of "+/boot+". This split is to enable verified
boot for confidential VMs later on:

- the boot loader will load kernel & initrd. To cryptographically verify them,
  each file individually(!) will be accompanied by a signature authenticating
  it to the boot loader
- the root filesystem itself will be protected against tampering using dm-verity
  (not individual files a protected, but the filesystem as a whole). The root
  hash for this needs to be stored in the initrd.

Both +boot+ and +root+ filesystem images are built using +make_ext4fs+. This
allows constructing the filesystems in a bit-by-bit deterministic fashion,
also squashing all timestamps (that are invariably non-deterministic by
docker). +make_ext4fs+ also assigns SELinux labels to all files in the
filesystem during build (the file contexts of the SELinux policy are extracted
from the system before the build.

== Bootloader build

Bootloader is built somewhat similarly to the Ubuntu system, but is
kept separately (the bootloader is never changed during system upgrades).

The +grub-mkimage+ utility is used to build both the EFI first stage loader
(built as +/boot/efi/EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi+, to be placed as +/EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi+
on the +efi+ partition) as well as grub loadable modules
(built in +/boot/grub/x86_64-efi+, to be placed in under +/x86_64-efi+ on
the +grub+ partition).

After this is built, the sub-directories +/boot/efi+ and +/boot/grub+ are
used to build VFAT filesystem images to go into the first two partitions
of the final disk image.

== Disk image build

The final disk image is built by setting up a partition table and transferring
the individually built filesystem images into their respective partitions.
The layout of the partition table is described in +partitions.csv+.
