= GuestOS Config Store

This document calls out some of the contents of the GuestOS *config* partition (*/dev/vda3* in the GuestOS disk image). The config partition stores information that must be preserved across system upgrades and needs to be available during early boot time. Consequently, this information cannot reside within the encrypted payload data partition.

Currently, all contents in the config partition are stored as plain-text without integrity protection.

These files are stored in `/boot/config` or `/var/lib/ic`. To see where each configuration file is stored, refer to link:../../components/init/bootstrap-ic-node/guestos/bootstrap-ic-node.sh[bootstrap-ic-node]

== Production configuration files

Not all configuration files and directories are required for GuestOS to run in production, as certain configuration files exist solely for testing and development purposes.

The following files and directories *are* required for GuestOS to run in production.

=== CONFIGURED

This file serves as a tag to indicate that the one-time bootstrap configuration has been completed. If the `/boot/config/CONFIGURED` file is not present, the boot sequence will search for a virtual USB stick (the bootstrap config image) containing the injected configuration files, and create the file.

=== store.keyfile

This file contains the key material used to derive the wrapping key for all block device encryption. The `store.keyfile` is created during the first boot, and encrypted partitions are configured with it.

In the absence of a sealing key (which will be available in SEV-protected trusted execution environments), the `store.keyfile` is stored as plain-text. Once a sealing key becomes available, it should be used to wrap the contents of this file.

== Development configuration files

These configuration files should only be used for development and testing purposes.

=== backup.conf

This file configures the usage of the backup spool directory.

Must be a file of key/value pairs separated by "=" (one per line) with the following possible keys:

- *backup_retention_time_secs*: The maximum age of any file or directory kept in the backup spool.

- *backup_purging_interval_secs*: The interval at which the backup spool directory will be scanned for files to delete.

This configuration file should only be used for testnet deployments (to achieve shorter retention times) and must be missing for production deployments, where suitable production default values are assumed.

=== filebeat.conf

Configures filebeat to export logs out of the system.

Must be a file of key/value pairs separated by "=" (one per line) with the following possible keys:

- elasticsearch_hosts: Space-separated lists of hosts to ship logs to.
- elasticsearch_tags: Space-separated list of tags to apply to exported log records.

If left unspecified, filebeat will be left unconfigured and no logs are exported.

=== vector.conf

Configures vector to export logs out of the system.

Must be a file of key/value pairs separated by "=" (one per line) with the following possible keys:

- elasticsearch_hosts: Space-separated lists of hosts to ship logs to.
- elasticsearch_tags: Space-separated list of tags to apply to exported log records.

If left unspecified, vector will be left unconfigured and no logs are exported.

=== socks_proxy.conf

Configuration for socks proxy.

Must be a file of key/value pairs separated by "=" (one per line) with the following possible keys:

- socks_proxy: URL of the socks proxy to use. E.g socks5://socksproxy.com:1080

=== bitcoin_addr.conf

Configuration for bitcoin adapter.

Must be a file of key/value pairs separated by "=" (one per line) with the following possible keys:

- bitcoind_addr: Address of the bitcoind to be contacted by bitcoin adapter service.

If left unspecified, the bitcoin adapter will not work properly due to lack of external system to contact.

== Injecting external state

*Typical bootstrap process:* On first boot, the system will perform technical initialization (filesystems, etc.) and afterwards, initialize itself to act as a node in the IC. The node is initialized using key generation on the node itself (such that the private key never leaves the node) and through joining the IC (the node gets the rest of its state via joining the IC). "Registration" to the target IC is initiated by the node itself by sending a Node Operator-signed "join" request to its NNS.

However, the typical bootstrap process can be modified such that the node is initialized using externally generated private keys and an externally generated initial state. All "registration" to the target IC is assumed to have been performed by other means.

The behavior is triggered through the presence of the following files:

- ic_crypto
- ic_registry_local_store

This behavior is suitable for the following use cases:

- Bootstrapping an IC instance: In this case, suitable state for all nodes is generated by ic-prep and then distributed across multiple nodes. This is used, for example, during testnet setup.

- Externally controlled join of a node to a subnet: In this case, ic-prep is used to prepare key material to the node, while ic-admin is used to modify the target NNS such that it "accepts" the new node as part of the IC.

=== ic_crypto

Externally generated cryptographic keys.

Must be a directory with contents matching the internal representation of the ic_crypto directory. When given, this provides the private keys of the node. If not given, the node will generate its own private/public key pair.

=== ic_registry_local_store

Initial registry state.

Must be a directory with contents matching the internal representation of the ic_registry_local_store. When given, this provides the initial state of the registry. If not given, the node will fetch (initial) registry state from the NNS.
