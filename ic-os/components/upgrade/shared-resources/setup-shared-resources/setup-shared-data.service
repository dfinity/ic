# Add an explicit sequencing to LVM setup. The observed problem is that the
# LV apparently becomes notified as "ready" through udev before the actual
# lvcreate command has finished. This results in filesystem setup racing with
# lvcreate performing a "wipe" of the LV, resulting in a destroyed filesystem
# in turn.
