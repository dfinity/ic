= Dynamic file system mounts

The exact partitions used for the +/boot+ and +/var+ filesystems depends on
what root partition the system is running from:

* A: +/dev/vda4+ -> +/boot+, +/dev/vda5+ -> +/+, +/dev/vda6+ -> +/var+
* B: +/dev/vda7+ -> +/boot+, +/dev/vda8+ -> +/+, +/dev/vda9+ -> +/var+

The system will be informed via bootloader command line whether it is
running as A or B. Since the root filesystem is conceptually supposed to
be immutable, the dynamic mappings cannot be stored in +/etc/fstab+.
This is addressed using a generator in the +mount-generator+ file:
Systemd runs these during early boot, and it will dynamically generate an
appropriate +boot.mount+ unit based on the boot command-line.
