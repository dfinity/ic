# This systemd drop-in creates a hard dependency for ic-replica.service on
# guestos-recovery-engine.service. This ensures that ic-replica.service
# will only start if guestos-recovery-engine.service has completed successfully.
#
# A service must declare its own dependencies, so this configuration is applied
# to the dependent service (ic-replica.service) rather than the dependency
# (guestos-recovery-engine.service).
