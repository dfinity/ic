# Give it enough time to "guarantee" that it finishes. A
# a rate of 400k-500k inodes per second was measured for
# the production systems, so this leaves room for
# 800M-900M inodes on the filesystems for now. Obviously, it
# is very bad if it really takes that long, but rather be
# patient than not booting at all.
# If we ever approach this limit, then we need to apply
# somewhat more complicated strategy where this may need
# to happen partially in parallel with some services
# running already. This is very tricky to synchronize, though.
