# When starting ic-crypto-csp, ideally --replica-config-file would directly point to
# /run/ic-node/config/ic.json5, but this file may be not available yet as it is generated
# only on ExecStartPre by ic-replica.service. As a temporary workaround, we are generating
# an ic-csp-service-specific version of ic.json5 of which only the parts related to crypto
# and logging are relevant.
