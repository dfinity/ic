= Bootloader

Bootloader is built somewhat similarly to the Ubuntu system, but is
kept separately (the bootloader is never changed during system upgrades).

The +grub-mkimage+ utility is used to build both the EFI first stage loader
(built as +/boot/efi/EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi+, to be placed as +/EFI/Boot/bootx64.efi+
on the +efi+ partition) as well as grub loadable modules
(built in +/boot/grub/x86_64-efi+, to be placed in under +/x86_64-efi+ on
the +grub+ partition).

After this is built, the sub-directories +/boot/efi+ and +/boot/grub+ are
used to build VFAT filesystem images to go into the first two partitions
of the final disk image.
