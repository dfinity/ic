# The prod nightly test groups partition the prod tests to parallelize across
# multiple testnets. In our case, we have 5 testnets so create 5 prod groups.
# This is a short term solution to speed up nightly tests, until testnets can be
# deployed dynamically using farm.

# The first testing group is reserved for the longest running test [6 hours].
# For new tests, try to distribute them evenly across testing groups. You can also
# inspect the Honeycomb traces for the rc--* branches to determine which group is
# the least utilized.

# TESTING NOTE:
# $SHELL_WRAPPER allows us to emulate CI runs without actually executing the complicated and time-consuming

#      While validating the CI configuration, "$SHELL_WRAPPER" will be substituted with "echo"
#      During actual execution, "$SHELL_WRAPPER" will be substituted with "time", i.e. will time the execution
