= IC_Replica_DivergedState
:icons: font
ifdef::env-github,env-browser[:outfilesuffix:.adoc]

== Triggered by

A replica's state has diverged from that certified by the subnet. When the
replicated state diverges, the replica saves the checkpoint into the
`diverged_checkpoints` dir and crashes; upon restart it reports the timestamp
of the latest diverged state, if any.

== Impact

Indicates a serious condition that is never supposed to happen.
Requires immediate debugging to prevent a potential subnet stall, if more
than one third of replicas diverge (e.g. as a result of increased load).

== Possible causes (non-exhaustive)

* A bug that leads to non-determinism in the Deterministic State Machine.

== Troubleshooting and remediation

* Inform the Message Routing team (at
  https://dfinity.slack.com/archives/CKXPC1928[`#eng-messaging`] or via
  `@team-messaging`) to start investigating the root cause and find a
  permanent solution
* Silence the alert as it won't stop on its own
