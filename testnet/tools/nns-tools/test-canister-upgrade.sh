Usage: $0 <CANISTER_NAME> <VERSION> (<CANDID_ARGS> <NNS_URL> <NEURON_ID>)
  CANISTER_NAME: Human readable canister name (from rs/nns/canister_ids.json)
  VERSION: Version to test (generally git hash, could be build id.  Green checkmarks on gitlab commit list have assets)
  CANDID_ARGS: Candid args to encode to include in the request.  Use empty string
   to skip if manually passing NNS_URL and NEURON_ID
  NNS_URL: The url to the subnet running the NNS in your testnet.
  NEURON_ID: The neuron used to submit proposals (should have following to immediately pass)

  NOTE: If testing cycles-minting canister upgrade, you may have to set SKIP_STOPPING=yes in your environment before
    running this script, if your upgrade arguments reference canisters not running on this testnet.

  This script will upgrade a canister on a given testnet with a given neuron id.  If that neuron does not have sufficient
  voting power to pass the proposal, the proposal will still have to be voted in.

# stop, which means we could never complete the upgrade. However, because they cannot return,
# it is safe to skip stopping when testing the upgrade of this canister, as replies cannot cause arbitrary code to execute
# when they return (which is the only reason for stopping in the first place).  The upgrade will still work, and
