### Added

- Initial release of the crate providing fluent assertions for metrics in Rust, designed for use with Internet Computer (IC) canisters.

- Support for both synchronous and asynchronous querying of canister metrics via:
    - `CanisterHttpQuery` (trait for sync HTTP querying)
    - `AsyncCanisterHttpQuery` (trait for async HTTP querying)
- `MetricsAssert::from_http_query(...)` and `from_async_http_query(...)` constructors to retrieve metrics from the `/metrics` endpoint and assert on their contents.

    - Adds support for integration testing with [`PocketIc`](https://docs.rs/pocket-ic).
    - Provides implementations of `CanisterHttpQuery` and `AsyncCanisterHttpQuery` for types that implement:
