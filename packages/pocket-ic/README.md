# Pocket IC

## A Canister Testing Framework for Community Developers

This is a prototype! 

This is a library for lightweight canister testing. Initially, it will target the state-machine-test binary and expose its client API, just like [this client library](https://crates.io/crates/ic-test-state-machine-client).
