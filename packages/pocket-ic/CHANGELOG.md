# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

### Changed
- Deprecated `make_deterministic`, use `stop_live` instead



## 3.1.0 - 2024-05-02

### Added
- Added `with_benchmarking_system_subnet` builder option to enable benchmarking with high message size limits.



## 3.0.0 - 2024-04-30

### Added
- New functions `auto_progress` and `stop_progress` to make IC instances
  progress (updating time and executing rounds) automatically.
- New subnet specification allowing to set very high instruction limits for (asymptotic) benchmarking canister code.
- New field `dts_flag` in `SubnetSpec` controlling if DTS is enabled (enabled by default on all non-benchmarking subnets).
- New functions `make_live` and `make_deterministic` configuring a PocketIc instance to automatically make progress (updating time and executing rounds)
  and creating an HTTP gateway for that instance listening at a dedicated port (and reverting that configuration, respectively).
- New functions `submit_call`, `submit_call_with_effective_principal` (submit an ingress message without executing it) and `await_call` (execute rounds on the PocketIc instance until the message is executed).

### Changed
- `get` and `post` helpers which are used by all server-facing functions now poll on results, because 1) instances can be busy with other computations and 2) the `post`ed computations may take longer than the specified timeout or the `reqwest` client's own timeout. With this change, very long-running computations can be handled by the library. 



## 2.2.0 - 2024-02-14

### Added
- a new `canister_status` function to request a canister's status

### Fixed
- `reqwest` dependency does not use the default features



## 2.1.0 - 2024-02-06

### Added
- Convenience functions `update_candid` and `update_candid_as`.
- New `set_controllers` method to set canister's controllers.
- Added PocketIC builder function `with_nns_state` to provide an NNS state directory. 

### Changed
- Use ExtendedSubnetConfigSet to be compatible with PocketIC server 3.0.0



## 2.0.1 - 2023-11-23

### Added
- Support for PocketIC server version 2.0.1


### Changed
- When the PocketIC binary is not found, the error now points to the PocketIC repo instead of the download link



## 2.0.0 - 2023-11-21

### Added
- Support for multiple subnets
- Support for cross-subnet canister calls
- Ability to mute the server's stdout/stderr streams by setting the `POCKET_IC_MUTE_SERVER` environment variable
- New struct `PocketIcBuilder` to create a PocketIC instance with a subnet configuration
- New constructor `PocketIc::from_config(config: SubnetConfigSet)` to create a PocketIC instance with a specified subnet topology
- New `get_subnet()` method to get the subnet of a canister
- New `create_canister_with_id()` method to create a canister with a specified ID
- New `create_canister_on_subnet()` method to create a canister on a specified subnet
- New `topology()` method returning a map of subnet IDs to subnet configurations
- New struct `SubnetConfig` returned by `topology()` to describe a subnet
- New struct `SubnetConfigSet` describing the desired subnet topology on initialization
- New enum `SubnetKind` to specify different kinds ob subnets

### Changed
- `create_canister()` method now takes no arguments, the anonymous prinicpal is used. To use a custom sender, use `create_canister_with_settings()`

### Removed
- `create_checkpoint()` method



## 1.0.0 - 2023-10-12

### Added
- Blocking REST-API: Encode IC-call in endpoint, not in body.
