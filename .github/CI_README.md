GitHub CI for the IC Repo

## Using custom CI labels
Note that setting custom CI logic via the pull request title has been deprecated and we now use labels instead. Reference labels that start with `CI_` to see available options.

Adding a label alone will not trigger CI, you will need to retrigger it by either opening & closing the PR or adding an empty commit with `git commit -m 'retrigger CI' --allow-empty`.

## Using GitHub Apps in CI
Our CI contains several automated steps to either generate commits or PRs, usually for linting or version updates. Previously we used Personal Access Tokens generated by a service account to create a commit or PR with the correct permissions but we have now moved to GitHub apps. These have several benefits:
- they generate a token which is only valid while the workflow is running, enhancing security and removing the need for regular rotation
- they can be managed via the organization and do not require a separate service account
- they can be installed on mutliple repos, however they only have access to the repo they are installed in

## Automated PRs by Bots
To increase security and prevent a bot from accidentally changing files that it shouldn't, we are introducing a new config file stored in `.github/repo_policies/bot_approved_files.json` in all public repos where any files changed by a bot must be listed. If not, the workflow will fail and the PR can't be merged.

Workflow defined in: https://github.com/dfinity/public-workflows/blob/main/.github/workflows/repo_policies.yml
