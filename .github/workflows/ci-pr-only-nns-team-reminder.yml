              If this pull request changes the behavior of any canister owned by
              the Governance team in an externally visible way, remember to
              update the corresponding unreleased_changelog.md file(s).

              To acknowldge this reminder (and unblock the PR), dismiss this
              code review by going to the bottom of the pull request page, look
              for where it says this bot is requesting changes, click the three
              dots on the right, select "Dismiss review", and supply one of the
              following reasons:

              1. Done.

              2. No canister behavior changes.

              To be more precise, "externally visible behavior change" usually
              means that responses differ in some way. However, "externally
              visible behavior change" is not limited to that. For example, it
              could also means that the canister makes different requests to
              other canisters.
