"""
Test(s) for the inject_version_into_wasm function defined in ../canisters.bzl.

Requires the following environment varianbles to be set:

  1. IC_WASM_PATH: Path to the ic-wasm tool, which can be installed via
     `cargo install ic-wasm`.
  2. STAMPED_WASM_PATH: Path to .wasm file generated by a inject_version_into_wasm
     rule. Such a wasm is supposed to have a WASM custom section named
     'icp:public git_commit_id'.
  3. VERSION_TXT_PATH: The contents of this file (with whitespace
     stripped from both ends) contains the value that's supposed to be
     associated with the aforementioned WASM custom section.
