# With hermetic toolchains, we would like to not depend on the openssl from the
# build enviornment. Normally the vendored feature would build the library from
# source alongside the crate, but this does not work when using rules_rust:
# https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_rust/issues/1519
# Instead, we build it ourselves, here.
