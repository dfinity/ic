# What?
# This file specifies which additional bazel targets to test for which specific file changes.
#
# Why?
# On PRs not tagged with CI_ALL_BAZEL_TARGETS, which is the default,
# CI only tests bazel targets which have modified inputs
# and excludes tests tagged as 'long_test'.
#
# This is problematic for targets that don't explicitly depend
# on modified inputs like the shell format check //pre-commit:shfmt-check
# for example which implicitly depends on the whole workspace.
#
# Furthermore, from experience we know that modifications to certain
# files or directories have a high risk of breaking certain long_tests.
# In those cases folks have traditionally labelled their PRs with CI_ALL_BAZEL_TARGETS
# to run *all* long_tests. This however is often overkill and often forgotten.
#
# To address both issues this file can specify which bazel
# targets to explicitly test based on which files were modified
# disregarding whether they're long_tests.
#
# How?
# The syntax is similar but not the same as gitignore
# (https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format):
# * A blank line matches no files, so it can serve as a separator for readability.
# * A line starting with # serves as a comment.
#   Put a backslash ("\") in front of the first hash for patterns that begin with a hash.
# * A pattern is separated by whitespace from its set of targets which are whitespace separated.
# * Patterns and targets don't support spaces in them. This might be added later if desired.
# * Targets can span multiple lines for readability.
#   So the targets on a line starting with whitespace
#   are considered part of the previous set of targets.
# * Unlike gitignore, patterns use simple globbing semantics:
#   https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html
#   So there's no negation of patterns or special directory handling
#   like gitignore wildmatch patterns.
#
# Tip: to test which files matches <PATTERN> you can use the following:
# git ls-files | python -c 'import sys, fnmatch; print("\n".join(fnmatch.filter(sys.stdin.read().splitlines(),"<PATTERN>")))'
