#   targets.py [-h] [--skip_long_tests] [--base BASE] [--head HEAD] {build,test,check}
#
# This script determines which Bazel targets should be built or tested and writes them separated by newlines to stdout.
#
# If --base is passed only include targets with modified inputs in `git diff --name-only --merge-base $BASE $HEAD`.
# When --head is not provided defaults to HEAD.
#
# If --skip_long_tests is passed, tests tagged with 'long_test' will be excluded.
#
# However, long_tests of which a direct source file has been modified will be included.
#
# Finally ./PULL_REQUEST_BAZEL_TARGETS is taken into account to explicitly return targets based on modified files
# even though they're not an explicit dependency of a bazel target or are tagged as `long_test`.
#
# When the command is `check` the PULL_REQUEST_BAZEL_TARGETS file is checked for correctness.
#
# The script will print the bazel query to stderr which is useful for debugging:
#   ci/bazel-scripts/targets.py --skip_long_tests --base=master test
#   bazel query --keep_going '((((kind(".*_test", rdeps(//..., set("ci/bazel-scripts/targets.py")))) except attr(tags, long_test, //...)) + attr(tags, long_test, rdeps(//..., set("ci/bazel-scripts/targets.py"), 2))) + set(//pre-commit:ruff-lint)) except attr(tags, "manual|system_test_large|system_test_benchmark|fuzz_test|fi_tests_nightly|nns_tests_nightly|pocketic_tests_nightly", //...)'
