# DO NOT put any configurations in this file! Common configurations must go in

# This file should only include other YAML files used to create the root parent

#
# If you want to remove or rename a file mentioned in this file please do so in
# two seperate MRs.
# 1.  Rename/remove the reference to the file from this file
# 2.  Rename/remove the file from the repository
# Failure to do so will cause the `gitlab-ci/config/zz-generated-gitlab-ci.yaml`
# file not to get generated.
