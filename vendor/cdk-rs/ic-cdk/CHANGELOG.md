## [unreleased]

## [0.19.0] - 2025-11-13

### Added

- Support Canister Environment Variable. (#636)
  - Add binding for `env_var_*` API.
- New Management Canister methods:
  - `canister_metadata`
  - `read_canister_snapshot_metadata` 
  - `read_canister_snapshot_data` 
  - `upload_canister_snapshot_metadata`
  - `upload_canister_snapshot_data`

### Changed

- [BREAKING] Updated to version 2.0 of the async executor. The `spawn` function now creates protected tasks that panic (or are canceled, with `spawn_weak`) if they outlive the canister method (with a new `spawn_migratory` function for tasks that are supposed to outlive the method). A trap will now cancel all protected tasks in the method it is part of. See the [module docs](https://docs.rs/ic-cdk/0.19.0/ic_cdk/futures/index.html) for more information.
  - The async machinery that is primarily used from macros (i.e. `in_*_context`) has been moved to `ic_cdk::futures::internals`.

- [BREAKING] Upgrade `ic-management-canister-types` which contains the changes for:
  - Canister Environment Variable.
  - Non-replicated HTTP outcalls.

## [0.18.7] - 2025-08-20

### Added

- The macros annotate `#[allow(clippy::disallowed_methods)]` above the invocation of `ic_cdk::futures::spawn`.

The `ic_cdk::futures::spawn` method has a different poll order that can affect canister behavior.
While some projects may wish to enforce a `disallowed-methods` lint rule to prevent its use, the invocations generated by our macros are a false positive.
This annotation prevents the warning from being triggered for the macro-generated code, ensuring a clean linting experience for developers who adopt the new rule.

## [0.18.6] - 2025-08-19

### Added

- Restored the default `skipping_quota` to match the behavior of previous versions of the macros.

### Fixed

- The macros now support 2024 edition.

### Changed

- MSRV raised to 1.85.0.

## [0.18.5] - 2025-06-25

### Fixed

- Tasks which return after canceling futures are no longer marked as trapped

### Changed

- Updated to `ic0` v1.0.0

## [0.18.4] - 2025-06-17

### Added

- New `ic_cdk::futures` function `spawn_017_compat`. This has the code ordering behavior of 0.17, with spawned futures run immediately instead of waiting for the current code to suspend.

## [0.18.3] - 2025-06-04

### Added

- Support `root_key` API. (#619)

### Changed

- Update bitcoin `regtest` cycles cost to be same as the bitcoin `mainnet`.

  ```
  fees = record {
        get_current_fee_percentiles = 10_000_000 : nat;
        get_utxos_maximum = 10_000_000_000 : nat;
        get_block_headers_cycles_per_ten_instructions = 10 : nat;
        get_current_fee_percentiles_maximum = 100_000_000 : nat;
        send_transaction_per_byte = 20_000_000 : nat;
        get_balance = 10_000_000 : nat;
        get_utxos_cycles_per_ten_instructions = 10 : nat;
        get_block_headers_base = 50_000_000 : nat;
        get_utxos_base = 50_000_000 : nat;
        get_balance_maximum = 100_000_000 : nat;
        send_transaction_base = 5_000_000_000 : nat;
        get_block_headers_maximum = 10_000_000_000 : nat;
      };
  ```

  You can get the fees by `get_config` API on the [BTC Mainnet Canister](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/ghsi2-tqaaa-aaaan-aaaca-cai).

## [0.18.2] - 2025-05-14

### Added

- New CDK library `ic-cdk-executor` containing the low-level async executor primitives previously in `ic-cdk`. Most users will never need to use this library and should continue using the interface from `ic-cdk`.

### Changed

- Bump `ic-error-types` to v0.2.0 from which we re-export the `RejectCode` type.

## [0.18.1] - 2025-05-09

### Added

- Support VetKD management canister API. (#597)
- Add `Call::take_raw_args` which owns the bytes. (#601)

## [0.18.0] - 2025-04-22

Please check [Version 0.18 Guide](V18_GUIDE.md) for more details.

### Added

- New `Call` API.
  - Supports bounded-wait inter-canister calls.
  - Uses a builder pattern for optional call configuration.
  - Allows chaining `.candid()` decoding only when needed.
  - Provides ergonomic Rust error handling to encourage best practices.
- Support for Wasm64 module compilation.
  - Seamlessly handles 32-bit and 64-bit System APIs.
- Enhanced macros for flexible argument decoding and result encoding.
  - `update`/`query`/`init` macros now support custom argument decoders via `decode_with`.
  - `update`/`query` macros now support custom result encoders via `encode_with`.
- Simplified module hierarchy with one level under the crate root.
  - `api` module offers consistent System API bindings.
  - `management_canister` module for convenient Management Canister calls.
  - `bitcoin_canister` module for direct Bitcoin Canisters calls.
- Enhanced cycles cost calculation for Management Canister API calls:
  - New system APIs exposed through the `api` module:
    - `cost_http_request`, `cost_sign_with_ecdsa`, `cost_sign_with_schnorr`, `cost_vetkd_derive_key`.
  - High-level bindings in the `management_canister` module accept call arguments by reference.
  - All relevant Management Canister methods now automatically attach the required cycles to calls.

### Changed

- Introduces a new task scheduler-based executor.
  - Capable of scheduling any async task, not limited to inter-canister calls.
  - The `futures` module is now public to expose functionalities related to the async executor.
  - The new implementation enables code to have (intended) surprising behavior - it is recommended to read the [module docs](https://docs.rs/ic-cdk/0.18.3/ic_cdk/futures/index.html)

### Deprecated

- Submodules in `api` are now deprecated in favor of root-level modules.
  - `api/call` -> `call`
  - `api/management_canister` -> `management_canister` & `bitcoin_canister`
  - `api/stable` -> `stable`

- Provide safe wrapper of `global_timer_set` in ic-cdk. (#475)

## [0.13.1] - 2024-03-01

### Changed

- Upgrade `ic-cdk-macros` to v0.9.0.

## [0.13.0] - 2024-03-01 (yanked)

### Added

- Add `is_recovering_from_trap` function for implementing trap cleanup logic. (#456)
- Allow setting decoding quota for canister entry points and inter-canister calls. (#465)
  * When defining canister entry points, we add the following attributes: `#[update(decoding_quota = 10000, skipping_quota = 100, debug = true)]`
    - `skipping_quota` limits the amount of work allowed for skipping unneeded data on the wire. If this attributes is not present, we set a default quota of `10_000`. This affects ALL existing canisters, and is mainly used to improve canister throughput. See [docs on the Candid library](https://docs.rs/candid/latest/candid/de/struct.DecoderConfig.html#method.set_skipping_quota) to understand the skipping cost.
    - `decoding_quota` limits the total amount of work the deserializer can perform. See [docs on the Candid library](https://docs.rs/candid/latest/candid/de/struct.DecoderConfig.html#method.set_decoding_quota) to understand the cost model.
    - `debug = true` prints the instruction count and the decoding/skipping cost to the replica log, after a successful deserialization. The decoding/skipping cost is logged only when you have already set a quota in the attributes. The debug mode is useful to determine the right quotas above. Developers can send a few large payloads to the debugging entry point and know the actual decoding cost.
  * When making inter-canister calls, we have a new function `call_with_config` to config the same decoding quotas described above. It's strongly recommended to use `call_with_config` when calling third-party untrusted canisters.

### Changed

- `ic_cdk::api::call::arg_data` takes `ArgDecoderConfig` as argument. (#465)

## [0.12.1] - 2024-01-12

### Changed

- Add "reserved cycles" fields to the management canister API: (#449)
  - `reserved_cycles` to `CanisterStatusResponse`
  - `reserved_cycles_limit` to `CanisterSettings` and `DefiniteCanisterSettings`

### Fixed

- The README file is now more informative and used as the front page of the doc site.
- The `call*` methods are documented with examples and notes.

## [0.12.0] - 2023-11-23

## [0.11.4] - 2023-11-20

### Added

- `query_stats` in `canister_status` response. (#432)
  
## [0.11.3] - 2023-10-12

### Added

- Another type of performance counter: "call context instruction counter".
  Can be fetched using either method below: (#435)
  - `ic_cdk::api::performance_counter(1)`;
  - `ic_cdk::api::call_context_instruction_counter()` as a shorthand;

### Changed

- Deprecate `ic_cdk::api::call::performance_counter()` in favor of `ic_cdk::api::performance_counter()`. (#435)

## [0.11.2] - 2023-10-11

### Added

- `cycles_burn` corresponding to system API `ic0.cycles_burn128`. (#434)

### Changed

- Upgrade `ic0` to `0.21.1`. (#434)

## [0.11.1] - 2023-10-11

### Changed

- Upgrade `ic0` to `0.21.0`. (#433)

## [0.11.0] - 2023-09-18

### Changed

- Candid Export workflow is changed. (#424)
  * No need to compile for WASI separately.
  * Canisters should still invoke `ic_cdk::export_candid!()` to export candid.
  * Then use [`candid-extractor`](../candid-extractor/) to extract candid from the canister WASM.

## [0.10.0] - 2023-07-13

### Changed

- Upgrade `candid` to `0.9`. (#411)
- Remove `export` module. Please use candid directly in your project instead of using `ic_cdk::export::candid`.
- Remove `ic_cdk_macro::import` module. See below for a new way to import canisters.

### Added

- Export Candid: (#386)
  * A wasi feature that builds the canister as a standalone WASI binary. Running the binary in wasmtime outputs the canister interface
  * Build step:
  ```
  cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown \
      --release \
      --package "$package" --features "ic-cdk/wasi"

  wasmtime "target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/$package.wasm" > $did_file

  cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown \
      --release \
      --package "$package"

  ic-wasm "target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/$package.wasm" \
      -o "target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/$package.wasm" \
      metadata candid:service -v public -f $did_file
  ```
  * In the canister code, users have to add `ic_cdk::export_candid!()` at the end of `lib.rs`. In the future we may lift this requirement to provide a better DX.

- Import Candid: (#390)

  * Canister project adds `ic_cdk_bindgen` as a build dependency to generate canister bindings
  * build.rs
  ```
  use ic_cdk_bindgen::{Builder, Config};
  fn main() {
      let counter = Config::new("counter");
      let mut builder = Builder::new();
      builder.add(counter);
      builder.build(None);  // default write to src/declarations
  }
  ```
  * In the canister code,
  ```
  mod declarations;
  use declarations::counter::counter;

  counter.inc().await?
  ```
