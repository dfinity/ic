# Security Policy

The security of the Internet Computer is essential to its success. If you
believe you have found a security vulnerability please report it to us as
described below.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not report security vulnerabilities and other bugs through public
GitLab issues. Instead, report them to DFINITY via email at:
bugs@dfinity.org. Please do not submit any third party code - only textual 
descriptions. Any comments, suggestions and recommendations you submit to 
us will be assigned to the DFINITY Foundation.

Thank you very much for taking the time to read and analyze the code of the
Internet Computer. This is very much appreciated.
