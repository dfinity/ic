# Install the Salt-Sharing Canister from Commit 374556b

__Proposer__: Boundary Node Team at the DFINITY Foundation

__Source code__: [374556b515a5c48782ddaf80cffb399cb83ce487][new-commit]

## Summary

The API boundary nodes are in a unique position to provide insights, as all external requests pass through them.
This data is valuable not only for the operation of the Internet Computer Protocol, but also for dapp developers.
As part of the [Levitron milestone](https://internetcomputer.org/roadmap#Platform%20Decentralization-Levitron),
work is being done to make these insights publicly accessible.

A key prerequisite for this milestone is the consistent anonymization of sensitive data.
To achieve this, the salt-sharing canister is proposed as a solution,
which securely distributes a shared salt exclusively to API boundary nodes,
enabling them to consistently anonymize sensitive data such as IP addresses.

For more information, take a look at the [corresponding forum post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/observability-with-the-new-boundary-node-architecture/41725).

## Verifying the Installation

First, make sure your Git repository is up-to-date.

```
# Option A. Get a fresh copy of the code.
git clone git@github.com:dfinity/ic.git && cd ic
# Option B. If you already have a copy of the ICP repo.
git fetch
```

Second, checkout the right revision of the code.

```
git checkout 374556b515a5c48782ddaf80cffb399cb83ce487
```

### Argument Verification

The [didc][latest_didc] tool is required.

[latest_didc]: https://github.com/dfinity/candid/releases/latest

Fingerprint the canister argument:

```
didc encode \
    -d rs/boundary_node/salt_sharing/canister/salt_sharing_canister.did \
    -t '(InitArg)' \
    '(
        record {
            salt_generation_strategy = variant { StartOfMonth };
            regenerate_now = true;
            registry_polling_interval_secs = 300 : nat64;
        },
    )' | xxd -r -p | sha256sum
```

This should match `arg_hash` field of this proposal.

### WASM Verification

See ["Building the code"][prereqs] for prerequisites.

[prereqs]: https://github.com/dfinity/ic/tree/374556b515a5c48782ddaf80cffb399cb83ce487/README.adoc#building-the-code

Build the release version of the canisters:

```
./ci/container/build-ic.sh -c
```

Fingerprint the canister module:

```
sha256sum ./artifacts/canisters/salt-sharing-canister.wasm.gz
```

This should match `wasm_module_hash` field of this proposal.
