//! Defines flags that can change a network's behavior.
//!
//! This module defines a global struct to control which
//! malicious behavior to enable in different components.
//! Both struct and fields have to be public
//!
//! Introducing a new malicious behavior starts with extending
//! this component struct with a new flag
//!
//! It is desirable to have a description for each flag in this file
