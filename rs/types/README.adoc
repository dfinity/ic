= Semantics of different packages in rs/types

== `ic-base-types`

Core types that all other packages, including Rust canisters, can share.
It should be possible to compile `ic-base-types` to WebAssembly.

Examples:

  * `PrincipalId` and `CanisterId`, with their candid derivations,
  * `NodeId` and `SubnetId`,
  * `NumBytes` and `NumSeconds`.

== `ic-error-types`

This package contains definitions of error types that the user of the IC can observe when they call the HTTP interface, such as `+ErrorCode+` and `RejectCode`.

Avoid adding component-specific error types to this package.

== `ic-management-canister-types`

This package contains types specified in the https://github.com/dfinity/interface-spec/blob/master/spec/ic.did[ic00 management canister interface].

This package targets the management canister implementation and tools to communicate with the management canister.

Avoid adding platform-specific dependencies to this package.

== `ic-types`

This package contains type definitions shared among all platform components: execution, consensus, messaging, p2p, etc.

In addition, another category of types contained here are the ones that require crypto signatures.

Avoid adding new types to this package unless you need to share these types among several components.
