# The goal of using package_groups is to decouple semantically different parts of the whole IC codebase.
# There is a 1-to-1 mapping between each package and a package group defined in this file.
# The relationship between package_groups is also defined here.
# In the future when upgrade to bazel >7, package groups will be moved into bazel modules so
# all the dependency rules between package groups will be more strictly enforced.

# The system tests package group contains all code related to system testing.
#
# Can depend on: any other package.
#
# Dependants: none.
#   Exceptions:
#       //rs/ic_os/launch-single-vm:__pkg__ depends on
#           //rs/tests/driver:ic-system-test-driver
#       //rs/pocket_ic_server:__pkg__ depends on
#           //rs/tests:ic-hs
#           //rs/tests/httpbin-rs:httpbin
