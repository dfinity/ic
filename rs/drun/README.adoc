= drun

A simple tool to install and test a canister, provided as a Wasm binary file, on a single node. The
primary use case is that of an Motoko-developer who wants to test Wasm binaries running on a single
node.

== Synopsis

[source,shell]
....
$ bazel run //rs/drun -- [-c <config.json5>] <messages_file>
....

* `-c <config.json5>`: (Optional) A json file containing the node configuration. If no config is
provided, default values will be used.
* `<messages_file>`: A line-based ASCII-encoded text file containing the messages to be processed.

== Configuration

In order to prevent concurrent instances of `drun` from interfering with each other, the directory
where the state manager stores snapshots and checkpoints will be chosen randomly, irrespective of
the value provided in the configuration file.

== Message Input File Format

Each line of the input file contains at most one message to be processed. All messages are processed
synchronously: The next message starts executing when the previous message has finished executing.
Three message types are currently supported: `ingress`, `query` and `install`. Messages are directly
deliver to message routing: there is neither a p2p nor a consensus layer.

=== Create Canister Messages

Create canister messages have the following format:

----
create
----

=== Code Installation Messages

Code installation messages have the following format:

----
<mode> <canister_id> <wasmfile> <payload>
----

* `<mode>` is one of `install`, `reinstall` or `upgrade`
- `drun` automatically detects whether the Wasm binary expects enhanced orthogonal persistence (as used in Motoko) and if so, sets the `wasm_memory_persistence` upgrade option.

* `<canister_id>` is the desired ID for the canister to be installed, given in textual
representation (e.g. `rwlgt-iiaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-cai`) as specified in https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec#textual-ids.

* `<wasmfile>` is a path to a Wasm file that should be installed in this drun execution.

* `<payload>` is a octet-string that is either encoded as an arbitrary length hex-string
(e.g. `0xffffff`) or a double quoted ASCII string. See string escape rules
section below for escape rules in strings.

=== Ingress Messages

Ingress messages have the following format:

----
ingress <canister_id> <method_name> <method_payload>
----

* `<canister_id>` is the ID of the canister for which this ingress message is destined. A canister
with the given ID has to be installed perviously using `install <canister_id> ..`.

* `<method_name>` is a C-like identifier (`[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*`). Examples: `_identifier`,
`read`, `write`, ...

* `<method_payload>` is a octet-string that is either encoded as an arbitrary length hex-string
(e.g. `0xffffff`) or a double quoted ASCII string. See string escape rules
section below for escape rules in strings.

=== Query Messages

----
query <canister_id> <method_name> <method_payload>
----

Same as above, except that the method call will be processed as a query, not as an ingress message.

=== String escape rules

** `\\` to escape `\`
** `\"` to escape `"`
** `\x[0-9a-f]{2}` for a hexadecimal representation (i.e., ``"A\x01\x02\x03"``  is equivalent to
`0x65010203`)
** `\b[01]{8}` for a bitwise representation (i.e., `"A\b00000001\b00000010\b00000011"` is equivalent
to `0x65010203`).

== Output Format

Each message produces exactly one line of output.

=== Ingress Messages

Each ingress message produces an output of the following form:
----
ingress(<msg_id>) <IngressStatus>: <WasmResult>
----

`<msg_id>` is the id given to this particular ingress message. Ingress messages are given
consecutive ids, starting with `0`. The fist ingress message (with id `0`) is the (implicit)
canister install message. Thus, the output stream always starts with a line indicating whether the
canister has been successfully installed, even if no input messages are specified. E.g., the
following line indicates that the canister has been successfully installed:

----
ingress(0) Completed: Reply: 0x{canister_id}
----

In principle, `<IngressStatus>` is one of `Received`, `Completed`, `Failed`, or `Unknown`. However,
as of now, `drun` waits until the execution of a message has been completed before starting to
process the next message. Thus, observing anything but `Completed` or `Failed` indicates a bug in
`drun`.

If the ingress message could be successfully executed (`Completed`), it is followed by the
the <<WASM Result>>.

=== Query Messages

If the hypervisor could successfully execute the query, the output starts with `Ok:`, followed by
the <<WASM Result>>. E.g.:

----
Ok: Payload: 0x010203
----

If an error occurs in the hypervisor, the output line starts with `Err:` followed by an error code.
E.g.:

----
Err: 404
----

Even if a message is passed to the execution engine, executing the message might still fail—e.g., if
the installed canister does not export a method with a method name provided in the message. In such
a case, the output starts with `CanisterErr:` followed by an error code. E.g.:

----
CanisterErr: 500
----

==== WASM Result

If the query is rejected by the method, the output is of the form:

----
Reject: <errorcode>
----

An empty query response produces the following output:

----
Empty
----

In case a payload is provided, it is encoded as an arbitrary length hexadecimal value. E.g.:

----
Payload: 0x010203
----

== Example Usage

Let us assume that we have a file `counter.wasm` containing a compiled version of the Wasm-module
given in the Appendix under <<Counter Module>>. Among others, the module exposes two methods,
`write` and `read`. The `write` method increments a global counter stored on the heap, while the
`read` functions just returns the value of the counter modulo 256 as payload—i.e. the least
significant byte of the counter.

Let us further assume that we have a text file `in.txt` containing the following messages:

----
create
install ic:0100000000000000000000000000000000012D counter.wasm ""
ingress ic:0100000000000000000000000000000000012D write "Hello"
query ic:0100000000000000000000000000000000012D read "Hello"
ingress ic:0100000000000000000000000000000000012D write "Hello"
query ic:0100000000000000000000000000000000012D read "Hello"
----

Running the command

[source,shell]
----
$ bazel run //rs/drun -- ${PWD}/in.txt
----

should result in the following output:

----
ingress(0) Reply: 0x{canister_id}
ingress(1) Completed: Empty
Ok: Payload: 0x01
ingress(2) Completed: Empty
Ok: Payload: 0x02
----

== Appendix

=== Counter Module

This module exports two methods, `write` and `read`. The `write` method is supposed to be called
with an ingress message, while the `read` method adheres to the query protocol as it calls the
`reply` System API method before returning. Both methods copy the first byte of the message payload
onto the heap. The copied byte is then used as an address into the heap to store or load a 32-bit
integer from the heap. The `write` method loads the global counter from the heap, increments it and
stores it back to the heap. The `read` method just returns the least significant byte of the counter
as payload—i.e. the value of the counter modulo 256.
