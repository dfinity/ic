//! Replicated state types.

//! Note [Replicated State Invariants]
//! ==================================
//!
//! Guidelines for handling invariants that are internal to datastructures in the
//! replicated state:
//!
//! - In this context, the term invariant is used to refer to something that (1) holds
//!   all the time, and (2) whose violation would affect code correctness:
//!   - We check these during deserialization and return an error if they don't hold.
//!   - It is also fine to assert/debug_assert (depending on how expensive these checks
//!     are) for them in production code.
//!   - Proptests for these invariants are recommended, but can be skipped if there is
//!     consensus that they are not needed.
//! - There can also be soft invariants which are a superset of the invariants above.
//!   - These include things that don't affect correctness of the code, but we still
//!     aim to uphold them at all times.
//!   - They can be self healing, i.e., a violation will be fixed upon the next
//!     modification of after the next couple of modifications.
//!   - We don't assert for them in production code, but may debug_assert and raise
//!     critical errors in case of a violation upon deserialization (cf. deserialization
//!     of `BlockmakerMetricsTimeSeries`)
//!   - An example for a soft invariant is an upper bound on the number of elements
//!     in a datastructure which maintains a sliding window of snapshots, where the
//!     actual number of snapshots does not affect correctness and we just want to make
//!     sure it doesn't grow indefinitely.
//! - We don't attempt to restore invariants or soft invariants upon deserializing
//!   as it could change the past.
//!
//! Note [Handling changes to Enums in Replicated State]
//! ========================================
//!
//! Enums that are persisted in the Replicated State require special handling
//! to ensure that changes to them are compatible across replica releases.
//!
//! Changes to such enums must be rolled out in stages, across multiple replica
//! releases. You must ensure that the release with the first stage of the change
//! is deployed to each subnet before proceeding with the second stage.
//!
//!  * If you are removing a variant, in the first stage remove all
//!   uses of said variant from production code (except its definition and any
//!   conversion logic); only once this change has been deployed to all subnets,
//!   in the second phase, remove the variant and update this test.
//!
//!  * If you are adding a variant, in the first stage define the
//!    variant and the necessary conversion logic, without using it anywhere (and
//!    update this test); once the replica release has been deployed to all
//!    subnets, it is safe to begin using the new variant in production code.
//!
//!  * If you are remapping the numeric code behind a variant, you must do it as
//!    concurrent removal and addition operations (see above). You can also
//!    rename the variant you are removing to `Deprecated<Name>` as part of the
//!    first step, so you can concurrently define the new variant and preserve
//!    the name.
