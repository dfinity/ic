= Rust crates

This directory should contain all the replica's Rust code.

= Kicking the tires

Warning: we are still working to clean up the documentation to provide a clean mapping of the rust code. 

In the meantime, the least we can do is provide you an easy way to do that very first thing _what we would_ do when encountering repos which look interesting: git clone them and see if they compile locally.

To do that simplest of steps:

1. install rust
2. ``cd rs``
3. ``cargo build --release --bin replica``
