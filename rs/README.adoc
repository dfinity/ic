= Rust crates

This directory should contain all the replica's Rust code.

= Kicking the tires

Warning: we are still working to clean up the documentation to provide a clean mapping of the rust code. 

In the meantime, the least we can do is provide you an easy way to do that very first thing _what we would_ do when encountering repos which look interesting: git clone them and see if they compile locally.

To do that simplest of steps:

1. install rust
2. ``cd rs``
3. ``cargo build --release --bin replica``

= Best practices

== Introducing new System API or changing existing one:

1. Specify the new API in the https://github.com/dfinity-lab/ic-ref[Internet Computer Reference] repository and consult the canister os team for any help or review needed.
2. Ensure that the acceptance test suite is updated: `hs/spec_compliance` and `rs/tests/testing_verification/wabt_tests`. Inform *@team-testing* of the work required.
3. Ensure that the Rust CDK is updated: https://github.com/dfinity/cdk-rs[Rust Canister Development Kit]. Inform *@eng-sdk* of the work required.
4. Ensure that Motoko is updated: https://github.com/dfinity/motoko[Motoko]. Inform *@eng-motoko* of the work required.
5. Implement the new API: `system_api` and `embedders` crates.
6. Unit tests: functionality and wasm validation code tests.
7. Update the implementation of the universal canister and replace `universal-canister.wasm.gz` with the newly generated one.
8. Update the interface of the rust canister and add tests.
9. Add system tests that cover the new API.
10. Once the *Public Spec* is released and implementation merged in the master branch, https://github.com/dfinity/motoko[Motoko] and https://github.com/dfinity/cdk-rs[Rust CDK] can be updated to use the new API. For more details, please contact *@eng-motoko* and *@eng-sdk*.
