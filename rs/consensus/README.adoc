= Implementation of Internet Computer Consensus Protocol

== Multi-node test simulation with test framework

We have built a simulated environment that runs consensus instances without real network to help debug consensus protocol and study its behavior.
More details can be found in the xref:test_framework.adoc[design document of the consensus test framework].

To run from command line and see debug output:

....
RUST_LOG=Debug cargo test --test integration multiple_nodes_are_live -- --nocapture
....

After the compilation, the beginning of the test log is something like below:

....
running 1 test
 INFO ConsensusRunnerConfig { max_delta: 1000, random_seed: 0, num_nodes: 10, num_rounds: 12, degree: 9, execution: GlobalClock, delivery: Sequential }
 DEBG finalized_height 0 expected_batch_height 0, Subcomponent: Finalizer, Application: Consensus, node_id: 0
 DEBG finalized_height 0 expected_batch_height 0, Subcomponent: Finalizer, Application: Consensus, node_id: 1
 DEBG Deliver RandomBeaconShare(Signed { content: RandomBeaconContent { height: 1, parent: CryptoHash(0xe3885881f2431daf22404d19a97d505feaa2fea5dcb82200c54ec7c0b836168a) }, signature: ThresholdSignatureShare { signature: ThresholdSigShare([]), signer: 1 } }), node_id: 1
....

The `INFO ConsensusRunnerConfig` line states the configuration under which this test was run.
All configuration parameters can be specified from the commandline so that it is easy to deterministically reproduce the same run for debugging purpose.

=== Setting parameters through environment variables

Because `cargo test` has its own command line arguments, we choose to set parameters as environment variables (case insensitive):

`RANDOM_SEED`:: An unsigned number that is used to seed all randomness used in the test, or `Random` which will choose a random seed. Useful for repeating a previous run. Default is 0.
`NUM_NODES`:: Numbers of nodes in the simulation. An unsigned number or `Random` (chosen from [1,20]). Default is 10.
`NUM_ROUNDS`:: Number of rounds the simulation should run. Default is to randomely choose between [10,100] based on `RANDOM_SEED`.
`MAX_DELTA`:: Maximum latency (in milliseconds) of delivering a message to all nodes. Only applicable to the `RandomReceive` and `RandomGraph` delivery strategies. Default is 1000.
`EXECUTION`:: One of `GlobalMessage`, `GlobalClock`, `RandomExecute`. Default is to randomly chose one of the three strategies based on `RANDOM_SEED`.
`DELIVERY`:: One of `Sequential`, `RandomReceive`, `RandomGraph`. Default is to randomly choose one of the three strategies based on `RANDOM_SEED`.
`DEGREE` :: Random graph degree (number of connections per node), only applicable to the `RandomGraph` strategy. Default is to randomly choose a suitable degree that is less than `NUM_NODES`.

For example, the following command will set up a network of 6 nodes and run until 100 rounds of finalized blocks are observed for all of them:

`NUM_NODES=6 NUM_ROUNDS=100 RUST_LOG=Debug cargo test --test integration multiple_nodes_are_live -- --nocapture`

=== Log levels

Besides the above, log levels can be specified using the `RUST_LOG` environment.
For example, the following command will only print debug messages from `ConsensusDriver`, and choose random parameters:

`RUST_LOG=integration::framework::driver=Debug ...`

Please also note that in order to show `Trace` level log messages, setting `RUST_LOG=Trace` might not be enough. You might need to modify `Cargo.toml` and change `slog` setting to something like the following:

`slog = { version = "2.5.2", features = ["max_level_trace", "release_max_level_warn" ] }`

It is enough to set it for `[dev-dependencies]` only.
As an example, the following shows trace level message for framework, but debug level messages for consensus sub-components:

`RUST_LOG=integration::framework=Trace,ic_consensus=Debug ...`

=== Stress test

Lastly, it is always a good idea to grind your machine with random consensus tests that will only stop in case of a failure:

....
while true; do \
  RUST_LOG=Info,ic_consensus::finalizer=Debug \
  NUM_NODES=Random RANDOM_SEED=Random \
  cargo test --test integration multiple_nodes_are_live -- --nocapture \
    || break; \
done
....
