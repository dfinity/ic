  // - a stateless version, without any stable memory proto, is adopted in code but never
  //   deployed to prod.
  // - a second change is made to re-introduce a stable memory proto which reuses tag 1.
  // - that second version is deployed to prod
  //
  // In this scenario, data with tag 1 could be misinterpreted.
  //
  // If the intermediate stateless proto is deployed to prod, the issue is alleviated as long
  // as the stateless version DOES wipe out the stable memory.
