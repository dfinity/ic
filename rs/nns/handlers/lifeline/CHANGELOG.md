# Changelog

Proposals before 2025 are NOT listed in here, because this process was
introduced later. (We could back fill those later though.)

The process that populates this file is described in
`rs/nervous_system/changelog_process.md`. In general though, the entries you see
here were moved from the adjacent `unreleased_changelog.md` file.

# 2025-11-07: Proposal 139315

https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/139315

Just a "maintenance" release, i.e. no behavior changes, just making sure that we
do not become too behind, and avoid too many changes piling up in for the next
"real" upgrade.
