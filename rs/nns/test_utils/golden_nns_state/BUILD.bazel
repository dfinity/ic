# Tests that use this should have

#
# When running such test via 'bazel test', pass --test_env=SSH_AUTH_SOCK to the
# command. This causes the SSH_AUTH_SOCK environment variable to be "forwarded"
# from your shell to the sandbox where the test is run. This authorizes the test
# to download the test data (assuming you are authorized).
#
# Additionally, the following flags are recommended (but not required):
#
# --test_output=streamed
# --test_arg=--nocapture
#
# These let you watch the progress of the test, rather than only being able to see the output only
# at the end.
