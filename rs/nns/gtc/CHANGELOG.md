# Changelog

Proposals before 2025 are NOT listed in here, because this process was
introduced later. (We could back fill those later though.)

The process that populates this file is described in
`rs/nervous_system/changelog_process.md`. In general though, the entries you see
here were moved from the adjacent `unreleased_changelog.md` file.

Just a "maintenance" release, i.e. no behavior changes, just making sure that we
do not become too behind, and avoid too many changes piling up in for the next
"real" upgrade.


# 2025-06-06: Proposal 136889

* This ensures that this canister will be ready for chunked registry records/mutations.
