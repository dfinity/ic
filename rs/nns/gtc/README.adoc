# The GTC for Mercury I

See the candid file (canister/gtc.did) for method overview.

## Run

The GTC can be deployed locally (unlike the other canisters that are part of the NNS). To do so switch to the directory `rs/nns` and run:

----
dfx start --clean --background
dfx deploy tokens
----

## Examples for all methods:

There are a total of 504 entries with a total of 219,213,542 tokens.

----
> dfx canister call gtc_rs len
(503)

> dfx canister call gtc_rs total
(219213542)
----

The balance of an address is:

----
> dfx canister call gtc_rs balance "006b572cd1af263c1f6c7c4d74f9260cd308c937"
(756)
