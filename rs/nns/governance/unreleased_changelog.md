# Next Upgrade Proposal

## Added

## Changed

* Neuron spawning and maturity disbursement finalization now read the locally
  computed Mission 70 maturity modulation (derived from the XRC-backed price
  history) instead of the CMC-polled `cached_daily_maturity_modulation_basis_points`.

## Deprecated

## Removed

## Fixed

* Tolerate XRC failures when updating maturity modulation: compute the average
  over available days using last-observation-carried-forward, and advance past
  days where XRC returns no rate so that a single persistent gap no longer
  stalls maturity modulation updates.

## Security
