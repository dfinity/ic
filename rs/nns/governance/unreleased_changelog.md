# Next Upgrade Proposal

## Added

* Collect metrics about timer tasks defined using ic_nervous_system_timer_task library.

## Changed

* Voting Rewards will be scheduled by a timer instead of by heartbeats.
* Unstaking maturity task will be processing up to 100 neurons in a single message, to avoid
  exceeding the instruction limit in a single execution.
* Voting Rewards will be distributed asynchronously in the background after being calculated.  
  * This will allow rewards to be compatible with neurons being stored in Stable Memory. 
* Ramp up the failure rate of _pb method to 0.7 again.
