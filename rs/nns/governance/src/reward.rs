//! Code for the computation of rewards distributions.
//!
//! This module makes use of floating-point computations. This is a reasonable
//! choice for computing rewards because:
//!
//! * Floating-point computations are deterministic and fully specified in wasm.
//!   In particular, rounding behavior is fully specified: https://www.w3.org/TR/wasm-core-1/#floating-point-operations%E2%91%A0
//!
//! * Floating-point operations are allowed in canister code.
//!
//! * The computation here happens pre-minting, and therefore there is no
//!   constraint that mandate fixed-precision.
//!
//! * Floating point makes code easier since the reward pool is specified as a
//!   fraction of the total ICP supply.

// ---- REAL-CODE ENDS HERE ---------------------------------------------

// Explication for the implementation of
// `rewards_pool_to_distribute_in_supply_fraction`
//
// The relevant extract from the spec is:
//
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------
// We derive the nominal maximum quantity of ICP that can be
// minted and distributed as rewards from the current ICP supply and
// the days since Genesis. To begin with, this is equal to 10% of the
// ICP supply divided by the number of days in the year (365 normally,
// 366 in a leap year). Over 8 years, this falls to 5%. Note that since
// the supply of ICP might grow (or even in theory fall) during this time,
// voting rewards may not halve in practice.
//
// * We want the rate at genesis to be 10% per year
// * We want the rate at genesis + 8 years to be 5% per year, and to be flat
//   thereafter
// * We want the rate to be a quadratic function of time
// * We want the rate to be differentiable wrt time at the point where it
//   becomes flat
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Calling R0 the initial rate at genesis time G, Rf the final rate, and T the
// time at which the rate becomes flat, the unique solution is:
//
// R(t) = Rf + (R0-Rf) [ (t-T) / (G-T) ]^2
//
// Note that:
// R(G) = Rf + (R0-Rf) [ (G- T) / (G-T) ] ^ 2 = Rf + (R0-Rf) = R0
// R(T) = Rf + (R0-Rf) [ (T- T) / (G-T) ] ^ 2 = Rf
// R'(t) = 2 (R0-Rf)  (t-T) / ( G-T )^2
// R'(T) = 0
//
// ---- BOILERPLATE CODE STARTS HERE ----------------------------------
// There's no way in Rust to derive Add, Sub, etc. So we must have a ton of
// boilerplate for arithmetic. The rest of this module is boring stuff.
