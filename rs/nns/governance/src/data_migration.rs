//! This module is the home of code that you call from post_upgrade and/or init,
//! and only has an effect once.
//!
//! Ideally, once such code is released, it gets deleted. At the same time,
//! ideally, it is safe for the same code to be in multiple releases.
//!
//! A typical use case is that you add some field, and you want to give it some
//! initial value, but thereafter, it can be changed as the result of requests
//! (e.g. create a proposal followed by many votes in favor).

/// If they already have Some value, the existing values are left alone.

/// Whereas, if values are missing (or voting_power_economics itself is None),
/// they get set according to DEFAULT_VOTING_POWER_ECONOMICS.
///
/// What we expect in production is that when governance is upgraded,
/// voting_power_economics will default to None, and during post_ugprade, this
/// gets called, causing voting_power_economics to be set to
/// DEFAULT_VOTING_POWER_ECONOMICS.
///
/// In testing, when a new governance canister is created,
/// voting_power_economics gets set in init, which also calls this.
