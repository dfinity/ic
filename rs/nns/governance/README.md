The (NNS) governance canister is the "heart" of the Network Nervous System
(NNS). This is where people stake ICP (i.e. make it not liquid) in order to
create "neurons". Using their neurons, they can then make proposals and vote on
them. Proposals can do things like

  1. Set the code that operates the Internet Computer (IC), including the
     governance canister itself.

  2. Add nodes to a subnet of the IC.

  3. Create a Service Nervous System (SNS). In short, an SNS is to a dapp as the
     NNS is to the IC as a whole. See the rs/sns directory in this repository
     for more information about SNS.
