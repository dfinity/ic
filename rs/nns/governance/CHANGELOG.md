# Changelog

Proposals before 2025 are NOT listed in here, because this process was
introduced later. (We could back fill those later though.)

The process that populates this file is described in
`rs/nervous_system/changelog_process.md`. In general though, the entries you see
here were moved from the adjacent `unreleased_changelog.md` file.

# 2025-01-13: Proposal 134777

http://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposals/134777

### Periodic Confirmation

Enabled voting power adjustment and follow pruning.

#### Prior Work

This section describes related changes in previous releases.

We already started recording how long it's been since neurons have confirmed
their following (aka refreshed voting power). Neurons were also given the
ability to confirm their following. Those who have never confirmed are
considered as having refreshed on Sep 1, 2024.

This feature was proposed and approved in motion [proposal 132411].

[proposal 132411]: https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/132411

#### New Behavior(s) (In This Release)

With this enablement, not refreshing for more than 6 months will start to affect
the neuron. More precisely,

1. If a neuron has not refreshed in 6 months, then votes have less influence on
   the outcome of proposals.

2. If a neuron has not refreshed in 7 months,

    a. It stops following other neurons (except on the NeuronManagement topic;
       those followees are retained).

    b. Its influence on proposals goes to 0.
