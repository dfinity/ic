        \* There are two ways that the user can invoke a neuron refresh:
        \* 1. by specifying an account ID
        \* 2. by specifying an existing neuron ID
        \* We only model the second option; the second should follow from the invariant that
        \* \A nid aid : neuron_id_by_account[aid] = nid <=> neuron[nid].account = aid

        \* The neuron_id is an argument; we let it be chosen non-deteministically
