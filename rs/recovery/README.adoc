# ic-recovery

The goal of `ic-recovery` is to combine functionality needed by recovery tests and actual recovery conducted on an IC subnet in a single, maintainable place.
To this end it provides a library of functions useful for recovery operations, such as `ic-admin` proposals, state up- and download, creation of recovery CUPs, etc. 

Using the same library functions, it additionally offers a command line interface guiding operators through the process of subnet recovery. Therein, required operations may be conducted by the tool automatically.

## Application Subnet Recovery
0. Install `jq` dependency.
1. Prepare `NNS_URL`, `SUBNET_ID` and the `REPLICA_VERSION` of the subnet to be recovered.
2. Execute the tool using `ic-recovery --nns-url <NNS_URL> --replica-version <REPLICA_VERSION> --dir <recovery_directory> [--test] app-subnet-recovery --subnet-id <SUBNET_ID>`.
3. Optionally specify more parameters (if known ahead of time), see: `ic-recovery app-subnet-recovery --help`
4. During execution **manually** ensure that nodes are halted/unhalted when prompted.
5. Similarly, ensure replicas have restarted on the new version before uploading the new state.
