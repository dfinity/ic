# ic-recovery

The goal of `ic-recovery` is to combine functionality needed by recovery tests and actual recovery conducted on an IC subnet in a single, maintainable place.
To this end it provides a library of functions useful for recovery operations, such as `ic-admin` proposals, state up- and download, creation of recovery CUPs, etc.

Using the same library functions, it additionally offers a command line interface guiding operators through the process of subnet recovery. Therein, required operations may be conducted by the tool automatically.

## Application Subnet Recovery
1. Prepare `NNS_URL`, `SUBNET_ID` and the `REPLICA_VERSION` of the subnet to be recovered.
2. Execute the tool using `ic-recovery --nns-url <NNS_URL> --replica-version <REPLICA_VERSION> --dir <recovery_directory> [--test] app-subnet-recovery --subnet-id <SUBNET_ID>`.
3. Optionally specify more parameters (if known ahead of time), see: `ic-recovery app-subnet-recovery --help`
4. During execution **manually** ensure that nodes are halted/unhalted when prompted.
5. Similarly, ensure replicas have restarted on the new version before uploading the new state.

## NNS Subnet Recovery On Same Nodes
1. Prepare `NNS_URL`, `SUBNET_ID` of the NNS subnet.
2. Before going forward, **manually** ensure that the NNS nodes are halted/that the NNS subnet is stalled.
3. Execute the tool using `ic-recovery --nns-url <NNS_URL> --dir <recovery_directory> [--test] nns-recovery-same-nodes --subnet-id <SUBNET_ID>`.
4. Optionally specify more parameters (if known ahead of time), see: `ic-recovery nns-recovery-same-nodes --help`
5. After going through all steps, upload the recovery artifacts (CUP and registry local store) to a well-known location and inform the Node Providers to restart their machines and run the GuestOS Recovery Upgrader.
