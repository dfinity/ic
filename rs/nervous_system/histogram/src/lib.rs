//! An "event" has some real number associated with it. For example, a request
//! takes 123 ms to process.
//!
//! The Histogram struct in this crate does two things:
//!
//! 1. Groups events based on
//!     a) the real number associated with the event
//!     b) binning scheme
//! 2. Counts how many events there are in each group.
//!
//! This is designed to plug into ic_metrics_encoder::MetricsEncoder::histogram_vec.
//!
//! A limitation of this is that instead of being able to use f64 for the real
//! value associated with an event, you must use i64. You can usually work with
//! this by picking a sufficiently small unit.
