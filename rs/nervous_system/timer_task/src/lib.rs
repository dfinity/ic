//! This module contains traits for defining timer tasks that runs indefinitely during the lifetime
//! of a canister.
//!
//! There are two dimensions regarding the types of tasks:
//! 1. Sync vs. async: whether the task is synchronous or asynchronous.
//! 2. Recurring vs. periodic: whether the task is scheduled to run at variable intervals (depending
//!    on the task's logic) or at fixed intervals.
//!
//! When the tasks are defined to implement the traits in this module, metrics are automatically
//! collected for each task into a `MetricsRegistry`. The metrics include the number of times the
//! task has run, the number of instructions used by the task, and a histogram of the number of
//! instructions used by the task.
//!
//! More considerations about the task types:
//! - Sync tasks are atomic, so its metrics include a count which increments when the task finishes.
//!   It's impossible for a sync task to start but not finish, or rather, such state can never be
//!   observed due to the execution model.
//! - Async tasks are not atomic, so its metrics include two counts: the number of tasks that have
//!   started but not finished, and the number of tasks that have finished. Its instruction metrics
//!   come from the `call_context_instruction_counter` which measures across multiple messages within
//!   the same call context.
//! - Periodic tasks are defined as a closure that can run multiple times. Therefore, its context is
//!   typically managed outside of the closure (e.g. part of the canister state). Note that if the
//!   task panics in one iteration, it will still be scheduled to run at the next interval. Usually,
//!   the task member should only contain a reference to the canister state. Note that if the task
//!   interval is T, the task will be scheduled to run at t=T, t=2T, t=3T, and so on, but NOT t = 0.
//! - Recurring tasks are repeatedly scheduled after its completion, and therefore there is more
//!   flexibility in how the next iteration can be scheduled, both in terms of the delay and the task
//!   itself. For example, the task can contain a cursor, and the cursor for the next iteration can
//!   be computed after the current iteration finishes, so can the delay. Note that if the task
//!   panics in one iteration, it will NOT be scheduled again. It can, however, catch any errors and
//!   implement its own retry logic by specifying the next task (e.g. the same as the one failed) and
//!   a new delay (e.g. exponential backoff).
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
