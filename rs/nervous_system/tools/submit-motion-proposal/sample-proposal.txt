title: A Tale of Two Motion Proposals
url: https://forum.dfinity.org/whatever

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This might just be the most wonderous motion proposals your eyes have ever
beheld.

# Rationale

1. It uses Markdown.
2. It makes so much sense.
3. Daniel Wong deserves a phat raise.

# Usage

```
bazel build \
    //rs/nervous_system/tools/submit-motion-proposal \

./bazel-bin/rs/nervous_system/tools/submit-motion-proposal/submit-motion-proposal \
    --neuron-id=42 \
    --proposal-file=rs/nervous_system/tools/submit-motion-proposal/sample-proposal.txt \
    --verbose
```

Note that the above can be run even if you do not have a dfx identity named
"hsm" (which must be based on an HSM device). What it would do is confirm that
your proposal file follows the required format.
