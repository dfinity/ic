// Test that the total number of SNS neurons created by an SNS swap is within the ceiling expected
// by SNS Governance (`MAX_NUMBER_OF_NEURONS_CEILING`). Concretely, the test compares this constant
// against the sum of intermediate limits set for various types of SNS neurons. These intermediate
// limits are not checked within just one canister, so testing their inter-consistency is done here.
//
// If a `CreateServiceNervousSystem` proposal is valid, its parameters must comply, in particular,
// with the following limits (checked at the time of proposal submission):
// - The number of SNS neurons per basket does not exceed `MAX_SNS_NEURONS_PER_BASKET`.
// - The number of SNS neurons created for direct swap participants in the worst case cannot exceed
//   `MAX_NEURONS_FOR_DIRECT_PARTICIPANTS`.
// - The number of SNS neurons granted to the dapp developers doe snot exceed
//   `MAX_DEVELOPER_DISTRIBUTION_COUNT`.
//
// However, the number of Neurons' Fund participants created by the swap in the worst case cannot be
// determined until the proposal is being executed (as before that, NNS neurons can opt in or out of
// the Neurons' Fund). Thus, the corresponding validation cannot be done at proposal submission time
// and is done by a different canister (NNS Governance, which currently implements the Neurons' Fund
// and is responsible for executing `CreateServiceNervousSystem` proposals).
//
// The main reason the number of SNS neurons must be limited is to avoid running out of memory in
// SNS Governance. Since SNS neurons originate from different sources (direct / Neuron's Fund swap
// participation; developer neurons; neurons created by staking SNS tokens after the swap), there
// are multiple intermediate limits used to ensure the overall `MAX_NUMBER_OF_NEURONS_CEILING`.
// This test checks that all intermediate limits are consistent, i.e., their sum does not exceed
// the ceiling expected by SNS Governance.
