== The peer-to-peer protocol of the Internet Computer ==

The peer-to-peer (P2P) layer of the Internet Computer is responsible for message delivery within subnets of nodes.
Each subnet operates a separate peer-to-peer network, and nodes within each such subnet use this network to send messages to each other.

On top of this layer there are multiple components that use the P2P layer to exchange messages between peers, the most famous being the Internet Computer Consensus protocol. 
Other components, including the state sync protocol, also use the P2P layer to exchange messages with peers on the same subnet.
