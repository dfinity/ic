| **Capability** | **Purpose** | **Implementation Requirements**

| PubSub-like library 
| Simplifies application development by abstracting one-to-many communication within a set of nodes.
| The library must implement https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency[eventual consistency].

| Multitenancy of applications
| Allows multiple applications to safely use the library, ensuring isolation and uninterrupted operation across all applications.
| Must implement fair scheduling across peers to ensure resource allocation and isolation.

| Operation in P2P networks with Byzantine peers
| Ensures reliable message publishing and creation rates, even in networks with faulty or malicious nodes.
| The implementation must provide a non-IO-bound API and be memory-bounded.
