| **Capability**
| **Purpose**
| **Implementation Requirement**

| PubSub-like library
| Simplifies application development by abstracting one-to-all communication within a set of nodes. By providing non IO-bound interface ....

| Multitenancy of applications
| Enables multiple applications to safely use the library, ensuring isolation and uninterrupted operation across applications.
| Fair scheduling across peers when at capacity

| Operates in P2P networks with Byzantine peers i.e. bad network or peers don't affect the rate of publishing/creating messages.
| Supports deployment in real-world environments, including networks with faulty or malicious nodes.
| non IO-bound and bounded memory.

| Scalable and resource-efficient
| Optimizes usage of shared resources (e.g., CPU, memory) to maintain performance under high demand and prevent resource exhaustion.
