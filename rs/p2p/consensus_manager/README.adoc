= Abortable Broadcast 
:toc:  

== Background 

[quote, Internet Computer for Geeks]
To guarantee liveness, the Internet Computer Protocol assumes a form of partial synchrony, which (roughly stated) says that the network will
be periodically synchronous for short intervals of time. In such intervals of synchrony, all undelivered messages will be delivered in less than time δ, for some fixed bound δ. 
The bound δ does not have to be known in advance (the protocol is initialized with a reasonable bound, but will dynamically adapt and increase this bound if it is too small).
Regardless of whether we are assuming an asynchronous or a partially synchronous network, we assume that every message sent from one honest replica to another will eventually be delivered.

== Overview  

This library provides an implementation of the https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22080[Abortable Broadcast] primitive.
This mechanism ensures that any message sent from one honest party to all other honest parties will eventually be delivered, provided the message is still active (i.e., it has not been aborted).

=== Key Features
* Delivery Guarantee: Messages sent between honest parties are reliably delivered as long as they remain active.
* Dynamic Adaptability: The implementation dynamically adjusts to changing network conditions, ensuring reliable message delivery without requiring fixed, pre-defined timing bounds.
* Fault Tolerance: The implementation is robust against Byzantine, malicious, or otherwise faulty peers. It avoids slowing down the producer of data and prevents unbounded message buffering, even in the presence of adversarial behavior.
* Finite Active Messages Assumption: The design achieves efficiency and simplicity by leveraging the assumption that there is always a finite number of active messages in the system. This assumption ensures predictable resource usage and prevents attacks that might exploit excessive message production.
* Simplicity: The interface is designed to be intuitive, exposing a channel API for publishing messages to all peers in the subnet.


This design makes the abortable broadcast primitive well-suited for environments with partial synchrony, where the protocol must handle a mix of honest and potentially adversarial behavior while remaining reliable, efficient, and easy to use.
