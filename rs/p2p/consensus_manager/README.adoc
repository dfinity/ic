= Abortable Broadcast 
:toc:  

== Overview  

This library implements the https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22080[_Abortable Broadcast_] primitive.  

Currently, the implementation has some limitations that restrict its generalization:  

- **ArtifactAssembler coupling**: The implementation is tightly coupled with the `ArtifactAssembler`, reducing modularity.  
- **Slot table deletions**: Deletions in the slot table are not propagated, which lead to inconsistencies.

| **Capability** | **Purpose** | **Implementation Requirements**  

| **PubSub-like library**  
| Simplifies application development by abstracting one-to-many communication within a set of nodes.  
| The library must implement https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency[_eventual consistency_].  

| **Multitenancy of applications**  
| Allows multiple applications to safely use the library, ensuring isolation and uninterrupted operation between all applications.  
| Must implement fair scheduling across peers to ensure resource allocation and isolation.  

| **Operation in P2P networks with Byzantine peers**  
| Ensures reliable message publishing and creation rates, even in networks with faulty or malicious nodes.  
| The implementation must provide a non-IO-bound API and be memory-bounded.  

| **Scalable and resource-efficient**  
| Optimizes usage of shared resources (e.g., CPU, file descriptors) to maintain performance under high demand and prevent resource exhaustion.  
| The library should expose a synchronous interface but implement asynchronous operations under the hood.
