| **Capability**
| **Purpose**
| **Implementation Requirement**

| Abortable Broadcast Interface (i.e. similar to PubSub interface but with abort capabilities)
| Simplifies application development by abstracting communication between sets of nodes, allowing developers to focus on application logic instead of low-level networking.
| Eventual abortable delivery 

| Multitenancy of applications
| Enables multiple applications to safely use the library, ensuring isolation and uninterrupted operation across applications.
| Isolation, Fair scheduling when at capacity

| Operates in P2P networks with Byzantine peers
| Supports deployment in real-world environments, including networks with faulty or malicious nodes.
| Bounded memory

| Scalable and resource-efficient
| Optimizes usage of shared resources (e.g., CPU, file descriptors) to maintain performance under high demand and prevent resource exhaustion.
