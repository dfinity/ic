# Next Upgrade Proposal

## Added

* A Node Rewards canister is being created which will eventually assume the role of calculating ICP rewards 
  for node providers based on the nodes that are running.  It will take this responsibility from the 
  Registry canister, so it can evolve in a more robust way based on additional performance data.
