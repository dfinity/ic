# Changelog

# 2025-03-17: Proposal

## Added

* A Node Rewards canister is created which will eventually assume the role of calculating ICP rewards
  for node providers based on the nodes that are running. It will take this responsibility from the
  Registry canister, so it can evolve in a more robust way based on additional performance data.
