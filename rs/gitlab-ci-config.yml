# Crates added to this file will be allowed to tests on GitLab but
# not cause the pipeline [or CI] to fail. This is useful for broken

#
# Precede every crate with a tracking bug.

crates_allowed_to_fail:

# Crates for which the tests should be built in release mode.
# The total job time is build + test execution time, and if a test runs
# in release mode, then build time is too long and the total job
# time becomes longer than if we build and run in debug mode.
