Title:: Consensus Safety Test

Goal:: Demonstrate that there are no conflicting states for different
replicas in the presence of malicious behavior.

Runbook::
. Set up one subnets with 3f+1 nodes, f of which malicious.
. Install a universal canister in an honest node.
. Continuously push messages to the canister's stable memory
. Pull the last sent message and compare with the expectation.

Success:: Check the messages have really been written to memory
by pulling the last one from a different node.
The `ekg::finalized_hashes_agree` does not detect different
hashes for the same height. This is part of `ekg::basic_monitoring`, and
hence, checked by default.

Coverage::
. Consensus doesn't break in the presence of simple malicious behavior

Caveats and Future Work::
. Add a check that certified state hashes also agree
. Work on a `certified_state_safety_test` where we flip bits of certified state and observe the replica restart.
