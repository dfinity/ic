Title:: CUP compatibility test

Goal::
Ensure that CUP artifacts are backward/forward compatible wrt to mainnet and branch replica versions.
This is essential in ensuring the compatibility of replica version upgrades.

Runbook::
1. Generate and serialize a structurally exhaustive set of CUP artifacts using the mainnet replica
   version.
2. Deserialize all artifacts using the branch version (= upgrade).
3. Remove all artifacts.
4. Generate and serialize a set of CUP artifacts using the branch replica version.
5. Deserialize all artifacts using the mainnet version (= downgrade).

Success::
All artifacts can be serialized and deserialized by the respective replica versions without errors
or violation of integrity.

Deserialization of artifacts failed. Modifications to data types that may be part of the CUP
artifact usually need to be performed in three stages. Please ensure the following:

- If you tried to add a new enum variant, make sure that it cannot be used by the replica during
  the first rollout.
- If you tried to add a new struct field, make sure that it is declared as `Option`, and its `None`
  values are ignored by the struct's `Hash` implementation. The field has to be initialized with
  `None` during the first rollout. In the second rollout, the field may be set to `Some(_)` value.
  In the third rollout, the field may be made mandatory and the custom `Hash` implementation may
  be removed.
- If you tried to remove a struct field, make sure that it is declared as `Option`, and its `None`
  values are ignored by the struct's `Hash` implementation. The field has to be initialized with
  `Some(_)` value during the first rollout. In the second rollout, the field may be set to `None`.
  In the third rollout, the field may be removed.

Afterwards, adapt the `ExhaustiveSet` implementation of your modified data type such that it only
creates instances in line with the behavior described above. In your custom `ExhaustiveSet`
implementation, link the ticket tracking the next rollout step of your change.

For instance, when adding a field as `Option` (first rollout), your `ExhaustiveSet` implementation
should link to a ticket implementing the second step, during which the field is set to `Some(_)`
and the custom `ExhaustiveSet` implementation is removed at the same time.
