## Motivation

Upgrade the ckBTC minter to try to unblock three transactions ckBTC → BTC (withdrawals) that are currently stuck since
2025.06.21.

After analysis, see this
forum [**post**](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/ckbtc-a-canister-issued-bitcoin-twin-token-on-the-ic-1-1-backed-by-btc/17606/202)
for more details, the problem appears to be due to the following:

1. An extremely low fee per vbyte was chosen by the minter for those transactions, which prevented them from being mined
   in the first place. We currently don’t have a satisfying explanation for how this low median fee was computed and are
   also investigating the bitcoin canister. A stop-gap solution was introduced
   in [#5742](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/pull/5742), to ensure that the fee per vbyte computed by the minter is
   always at least 1.5 sats/vbyte (for Bitcoin Mainnet).
2. There is a deterministic panic occurring in the minter when it tries to resubmit those transactions, which explains
   why those transactions are currently stuck. This should be completely fixed
   by [#5713](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/pull/5713).
