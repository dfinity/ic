//! Traits providing the crypto component interfaces for a threshold ECDSA protocol.
//!
//! A set of nodes can use a threshold ECDSA protocol to establish a decentralized ECDSA signing service.
//! The protocol is secure as long as the number of corrupted nodes is less than the threshold (typically
//! less than 1/3). The main building block used in the protocol is an interactive distributed key generation
//! protocol (IDKG), which is used for the following:
//! * Generate an ECDSA signing key, which is secret-shared between the participants.
//! * Re-share an existing ECDSA signing key to a new set of nodes, e.g. if nodes leave or join a subnet, or
//!   to back up the key on a another subnet.
//! * Secret-share random values (also known as Beaver triplets) used in the computation of threshold ECDSA
//!   signatures.
//!
//! A signing service supporting multiple users needs to manage many public keys, often several per users.
//! Since generating and managing these is expensive, it would not scale to generate different keys per user.
//! Instead, the threshold ECDSA protocol implemented by the IC uses key derivation to derive individual
//! users public keys from a master ECDSA signing key. The key derivation is a generalization of BIP32, and
//! users can further derive any number of subkeys from their main public key. This allows the signing service
//! to easily scale with the number of users.
//!
//! At an high-level, the ECDSA signing protocol can be divided into an offline and online phase:
//! * Offline phase: this is a pre-computation step that can be performed ahead of time, before the message and
//!   the identity of the signer are known to the nodes. Most of the interaction takes place in this phase of the
//!   protocol. This phase consists of running 5 instances of the IDKG protocol to construct a *quadruple* of
//!   secret-shared values that are used in the online phase of the protocol (the value generated in one of the
//!   instances is used as an intermediary value and it is not used in the signing protocol). Each quadruple can
//!   only be used in the construction of a single ECDSA signature.
//! * Online phase: this phase is executed to answer an incoming signature request, i.e. once the message and
//!   the identity of the signer are known. This part of the protocol is non-interactive, i.e all nodes use their
//!   shares of a precomputed quadruple to compute locally a signature share. Enough shares can then be publicly
//!   combined into a full ECDSA signature.

/// A Crypto Component interface to run interactive distributed key generation (IDKG) protocol as part of the
/// threshold ECDSA protocol. Nodes can engage in an instance of the IDKG protocol to secret-share some values.
/// A successful execution of the protocol terminates with a *transcript* which summarizes the messages exchanged
/// during the protocol.
///
/// # Protocol Overview:
/// The IDKG protocol involves two sets of participants interacting in the protocol: *dealers* and *receivers*.
/// The set of dealers jointly constructs a common secret, which is secret-shared to the set of the receivers.
/// I.e. each receiver obtains a piece of the common secret, such that a threshold number of receivers has to
/// contribute with their shares in order to reconstruct the full secret.
///
/// Before starting the protocol, the node in a subnet agree on some global parameters [`IDkgTranscriptParams`],
/// including, for example, the set of participants, which elliptic curve should be used, and an identifier for the
/// protocol instance. The params used in a protocol instance must remain the same for the entire duration of the
/// protocol.
///
/// ## Dealings:
/// Dealers contribute to the protocol with a *dealing*, which consists of encrypted shares of a secret value known
/// by the dealer, one encrypted share for each receiver, as well as a commitment to the shares. The protocol uses
/// different types of commitments schemes:
/// * Perfectly hiding commitments, as used in Pedersen's  verifiable secret sharing scheme (VSS). Here we refer to
///   values committed with such commitment as `Masked`.
/// * Perfectly binding commitments, as used in Feldman's VSS. Here we refer to values committed with such commitment
///   as `Unmasked`.
///
/// Dealers can construct dealings for different kind of secrets and use different types of commitment schemes:
/// * [`Random`]: at the end of the protocol the receivers have a share of a new random value that is masked.
/// * [`ReshareOfMasked`]: given an existing masked secret shared between the dealers, at the end the receivers obtain
///   a new sharing for the same secret, but unmasked.
/// * [`ReshareOfUnmasked`]: given an existing unmasked secret shared between the dealers, at the end the receivers
///   obtain a new sharing for the same secret, that is still unmasked.
/// * [`UnmaskedTimesMasked`]: given two existing secrets, one masked and one unmasked, shared between the dealers,
///   at the end the receivers obtain a sharing of the product of the initial secret that is masked.
///
/// Since this is an *interactive* distributed key generation protocol, the verification of encrypted shares in a dealing
/// is done privately by the receivers, which decrypt their shares and check the validity against some public commitment.
/// This is in contrast with non-interactive DKG protocols, where the verification of dealings can be performed publicly.
/// In case the verification is successful, receivers sign the dealings to show their support.
///
/// ## Transcripts:
/// Multiple dealings contributions from different dealers are required to establish a common secret. The minimum
/// number of contributions depends both on the reconstruction threshold and on the kind of secret value being shared.
/// Once enough dealings with sufficient receivers' support are collected, they are then combined into a transcript
/// [`IDkgTranscript`] which summarizes all the information the receivers need to reconstruct their share of the
/// common secret.
///
/// ## Complaints:
/// After a transcript is successfully created, it could happen that a receiver cannot successfully decrypt all its
/// shares from the dealers. If this happens the receiver can compute a [`IDkgComplaint`] against specific dealings
/// and send this to all the other receivers. The receivers can verify the complaint and, if valid, return an
/// [`IDkgOpening`] to the issuer of the complaint. Given enough valid openings, the issuer can reconstruct the missing
/// share.
///
/// # Use-Cases
///
/// ## Key Generation
///
/// * Dealers: all the nodes in a subnet.
/// * Receivers: same nodes as the set of dealers.
/// The nodes run two instances of the IDKG protocol in sequence:
/// 1. Run IDKG protocol to generate a [`Random`] secret key. Since the commitment used here is masking, the nodes do
///    not yet know the corresponding public key, but only a share of it.
/// 2. Run IDKG protocol to do a [`ReshareOfMasked`] secret key generated in the previous protocol instance. Since the
///    commitment used here is unmasked, the nodes will then learn the public key corresponding to the secret key
///    generated in the first instance.
///
/// ## Key Re-sharing
///
/// When the membership of subnet changes or in case shares associated with the key needs to be refreshed (e.g. for proactive
/// security), the nodes of the subnet run one instance of the IDKG protocol.
/// * Dealers: nodes that were receivers in the IDKG instance that generated the key to be re-shared.
/// * Receivers: all nodes in the subnet with the new topology (which may include new nodes and exclude nodes that were
///   removed).
/// The nodes re-share a key by running a single IDKG protocol instance:
/// 1. Run IDKG protocol to do a [`ReshareOfUnmasked`] key that was previously generated.
///
/// ## XNet Key Re-sharing
///
/// Subnets can share an existing key with another subnet, e.g. to back it up or to scale the threshold ECDSA protocol.
/// Half of the IDKG protocol runs in the source subnet that knows the key, while the other half runs in a target subnet
/// receiving a copy of the key.
/// * Dealers: all nodes in the source subnet
/// * Receivers: all nodes in the target subnet. Note that this subnet does not need to exist yet, it could be under
///   construction
///
/// The nodes run a single IDKG protocol instance:
/// * The source subnet initiate a protocol to [`ReshareOfUnmasked`] key that was previously generated.
/// * The source subnet collects enough dealings into [`InitialIDkgDealings`] that are then included in the registry.
/// * The target subnet fetches the [`InitialIDkgDealings`] from the registry and completes the execution of the protocol.
///
/// No communication between the source and target subnets is required apart from the registry. This is possible by
/// making sure that the initial dealings include enough honest dealings, so that the receivers can terminate the protocol.
/// I.e. with at most f corruptions, a set of >=2f+1 dealings from distinct dealers is guaranteed to have at least f+1
/// honest dealings.
