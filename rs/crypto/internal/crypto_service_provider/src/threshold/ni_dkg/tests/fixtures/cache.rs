//! Cached DKG transcripts for tests.
//!
//! Note: Using one precomputed test fixture provides less thorough testing than
//! generating many fixtures with proptest.  However computing a fixture is
//! expensive and can be prohibitive for small tests, and unjustified in cases
//! where the exact contents of the fixture is not hugely relevant for the test.
//! Caching the fixture allows fine grained tests with minimal per-test runtime
//! cost.
//!
//! Warning: Nothing comes for free.  The CSP has a small mutable state - the
//! RNG and the key store - and it is not cloneable and should not be cloneable.
//! Theoretically one test could cause another to fail.  Given that the CSP
//! should be able to run as a service and satisfy each test sequentially,
//! running one test followed by another SHOULD not affect the outcome.  This is
//! morally equivalent to spinning up a testnet and firing requests at the
//! testnet, expecting each request to be handled correctly regardless of
//! previous requests.  If this assumption is unreasonable for your test, do not
//! use the static fixture.  Generate your own NiDKG.
