//! External API for Threshold Signatures
//!
//! The threshold signature scheme has the following participants:
//! * Signatories are actors who hold a threshold key and can sign with that
//!   key.
//! * Dealers are actors who generate keys that are then distributed to
//!   signatories.
//! * Verifiers are actors who can verify that signatures are valid.
//!
//! The key properties of this threshold signature scheme:
//! * The public output of key generation is a set of `PublicCoefficients`.
//! * Individual signatures can be verified against the public coefficients.
//! * Individual signatures can be combined.  If there are enough individual
//!   signatures, and they are all valid, the combined signature is guaranteed
//!   to be valid and can be validated against the `PublicCoefficients`.
//! * The minimum number of individual signatures needed to make a valid
//!   combined signature is called the `threshold`.
//! * A valid combined signature is unique and the same, regardless of which
//!   threshold signatures were combined.
//! * The combined signature has constant size, regardless of the number of
//!   signatures or the threshold.  In this implementation that constant size is
//!   the same as a single individual signature.
//! * If some individual signatures are invalid, the combined signature is
//!   likely to be invalid.  Individual signatures SHOULD be checked before
//!   combining.
//!
//! Implementation notes:
//! * Potential signatories are stored in a list.  It is important to preserve
//!   the order of signatories, especially in the case of distributed key
//!   generation where multiple keys may be dealt for each signatory.
//! * The standard form for storing signatory information is `Vec<T>`,
//!   where: the index in the vector corresponds to the signatory index
//! * The external API methods are equivalent to internal methods but use opaque
//!   data types. The external API parses requests to the internal types, calls
//!   the corresponding internal methods and serialises the responses.
