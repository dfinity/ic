//! Defines a canister which is used in testing Canister HTTP Calls feature.
//!
//! The canister receives HTTP request through inbound message, decodes the HTTP request
//! and forwards it to targeted service. Canister returns the remote service call response
//! as a canister message to client if the call was successful and agreed by majority nodes,
//! otherwise errors out.
