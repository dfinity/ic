/// Replies to or defers to another canister a list of actions (call or response commands),
/// along with counters keeping track of:
///  - The current call depth in the call tree.
///  - The total number of calls made.
///  - The sum of call tree depths at which these calls were made.
///
/// At each step, the first command in the actions list is extracted and executed. Therefore
/// the actions list becomes shorter at each step and traverses the call tree that it's elements
/// describe.
///
/// Once the list has exhausted all commands anywhere in the call tree, response commands are
/// executed until the tree is concluded and a response to the initiating ingress message is
/// formed.
///
/// The tree may also be concluded by sufficiently many response commands in a sequence in the
/// action list itself (even if the list is not empty at the time of conclusion).
///
/// Any action list will produce a finite call tree, provided the canister IDs it contains
/// correspond to running 'downstream-call-test-canisters'.
///
/// See `test_linear_sequence_call_tree_depth` and `test_multiple_branches_call_tree_depth` in
/// 'rs/messaging/tests/call_tree_tests.rs' for examples on how to use this canister.
