# SNS testing

To run the scenario on the local PocketIC instance:
1) Launch PocketIC server: `bazel run //rs/pocket_ic_server:pocket-ic-server -- --ttl 6000 --port 8888`
2) Launch SNS testing scenario on it: `bazel run //rs/sns/testing:cli -- --server-url "http://127.0.0.1:8888"`

Open local NNS dapp instance: http://qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai.localhost:8080/proposals/?u=qoctq-giaaa-aaaaa-aaaea-cai.
You should be able to see executed proposals to add SNS WASM to SNS-W canisters (since currently used NNS dapp is slightly outdated, make sure to clear topic filters).

The scenario installs [test canister](./canister/canister.rs) and creates new SNS with it.
Once the proposal is adopted, the scenario initiates the SNS swap and closes it by providing sufficient amount of ICP.
Once swap is completed, the test canister is upgraded via SNS voting.

NNS dapp should show the NNS proposal to create the new SNS as well as proposal in the newly created SNS to upgrade
the controlled canister.

To interact with the network created by `sns-testing` CLI, you should add the following network config to
`~/.config/dfx/networks.json`:
```
{
  "sns-testing": {
    "bind": "127.0.0.1:8080"
  }
}
```

Now you can call the testing canister by its id (note that the actual id may vary, make sure to check logs, or NNS proposal info in NNS dapp):
```
dfx canister --network pocket-ic-system call mxqf3-4h777-77775-qaaaa-cai greet "IC"
```

To get the latest NNS proposal info:
```
./dfx canister --network sns-testing call rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai list_proposals '(record { include_reward_status = vec {}; include_status = vec {}; exclude_topic = vec {}; limit = 1 })'
```
