# Changelog

Proposals before 2025 are NOT listed in here, because this process was
introduced later. (We could back fill those later though.)

The process that populates this file is described in
`rs/nervous_system/changelog_process.md`. In general though, the entries you see
here were moved from the adjacent `unreleased_changelog.md` file.


INSERT NEW RELEASES HERE

* https://nns.ic0.app/proposal/?proposal=134906

    Enable upgrading SNS-controlled canisters using chunked WASMs. This is implemented as an extension
of the existing `UpgradeSnsControllerCanister` proposal type with new field `chunked_canister_wasm`.
This field can be used for specifying an upgrade of an SNS-controlled *target* canister using
a potentially large WASM module (over 2 MiB) uploaded to some *store* canister, which:
    * must be installed on the same subnet as target.
    * must have SNS Root as one of its controllers.
    * must have enough cycles for performing the upgrade.
