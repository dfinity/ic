# Next Upgrade Proposal

## Added

### New `RegisterExtension` proposal type

A new proposal type, `RegisterExtension`, is added for registering SNS extensions.
Extensions are a new class of SNS canisters that (unlike SNS-controlled dapp canisters)
can operate on behalf of the DAO, e.g., by managing a portion of the treasury funds.

Note that while `RegisterExtension` proposals are already recognized, they are not enabled yet.
