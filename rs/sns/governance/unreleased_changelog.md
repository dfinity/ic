# Next Upgrade Proposal

## Added

Enable upgrading SNS-controlled canisters using chunked WASMs. This is implemented as an extension
of the existing `UpgradeSnsControllerCanister` proposal type with new field `chunked_canister_wasm`.
This field can be used for specifying an upgrade of an SNS-controlled *target* canister using
a potentially large WASM module (over 2 MiB) uploaded to some *store* canister, which:
* must be installed on the same subnet as target.
* must have SNS Root as one of its controllers.
* must have enough cycles for performing the upgrade.
