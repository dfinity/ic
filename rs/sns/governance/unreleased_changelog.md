# Next Upgrade Proposal

## Added

### New `get_metrics` function for SNS Governance

A new function, `get_metrics`, has been added to the SNS Governance canister. This allows front-end clients and SNS aggregators to query for activity metrics of an SNS over a specified time period. Currently, the metrics include the number of most-recent proposals and the timestamp of the latest SNS ledger transaction.
