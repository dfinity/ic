# Next Upgrade Proposal

## Added

### New Feature: `get_metrics` Function for SNS Governance 

A new function, `get_metrics`, has been added to the SNS Governance system. This allows front-end clients and SNS aggregators to query and retrieve activity metrics of an SNS over a specified time period.
This feature can be integrated into dashboard to help users gauge the recent activity and activeness level of a given SNS; supporting decision-making for users based on SNS activity patterns.
