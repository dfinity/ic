//! Integration tests for the SNS canisters.
//!
//! These tests instantiate a local replica, install the SNS canisters and then
//! proceed to perform operations and verify they completed successfully, and
//! that the state is the expected one.
//!
//! This is not a library at all. However, if this was under `tests/`, then each
//! file would become its own crate, and the tests would run sequentially. By
//! pretending it's a library with several modules inside, `cargo test` is
//! supposed to run all tests in parallel, because they are all in the same
//! crate.
