// NOTE TO POTENTIAL CLIENTS
// =========================
// This API is a draft, it may change in the next few weeks. Please stay tuned, and await the final
// version before implementing your canister code or tooling that relies on this API. Thank you for
// your interest!
//
// Instructions for Treasury Manager implementers
// ==============================================
// 1. An implementation of this API can be integrated into the SNS framework only if it is blessed
//    by the NNS community.
// 2. Before blessing a particular implementation, the NNS community will review the implementation.
//    The following requirements will be taken into account:
//    - The implementation must be open source, version controlled, and publically available
//      at a known location.
//    - The purpose of the implementation must be clearly stated, and the implementation must
//      be designed to achieve exactly that purpose.
//    - Implementations that rely on external trusted components (e.g., DEXs) must attest to those
//      components being reputable and trustworthy. At the very least, the external components
//      should be controlled by a DAO.
//    - The implementation must be well documented at least on the system design level.
//    - The implementation must be well tested: there should be unit tests for all used functions,
//      and there should be integration tests for both the happy scenario as well as scenarios
//      that demonstrate resilience of the implementation to external compotent failures.
//    - The implementation must have a public audit report / code review by at least one reputable
//      third party that is not affiliated with the implementation team. It is up to the NNS
//      community to decide whether a particular audit report is sufficient. These discussions
//      should be driven by the developers of a Treasury Manager implementation, e.g.,
//      using https://forum.dfinity.org.
// 3. This API assumes that the underlying ledgers are operated in a reasonable way. In particular,
//    chnaging the total supply of tokens is not taken into account. This assumption makes sense
//    for ledgers that are operated by DAOs, e.g., the ICP ledger and the native ledger of the SNS
//    that registers a Treasury Manager extension. However, anyone can deploy a ledger canister
//    and remain its controller; as a rule of thumb, such ledgers should not be trusted by DAOs.

// Part O. Common types
// ====================

// This might be different from, e.g., ICRC-2 allowances; it's just a way to specify how much
// assets are expected to be available for the manager. Whether to use ICRC-1, ICRC-2, or something
// else is an implementation detail.
type Allowance = record {
  asset : Asset;
  amount_decimals : nat;

  // Needed to refund excess assets that cannot be managed at this time.
  owner_account : Account;
};

type Asset = variant {
  Token : record {
    ledger_fee_decimals : nat;
    ledger_canister_id : principal;
    symbol : text;
  };
};

type Account = record {
  owner : principal;
  subaccount : opt blob;
};

// Part A. Canister init / upgrade arguments
// =========================================

type TreasuryManagerArg = variant {
  Upgrade : record {};
  Init : TreasuryManagerInit;
};

type TreasuryManagerInit = record {
  allowances : vec Allowance;
};

// Part B. Update function requests
// ================================

type DepositRequest = record {
  allowances : vec Allowance;
};

type WithdrawRequest = record {
  // Maps Ledger canister IDs of assets to be withdrawn to the respective withdraw accounts.
  //
  // If not set, accounts specified at the time of deposit will be used for the withdrawal.
  withdraw_accounts : opt vec record { principal; Account };
};

// Part C. Result of a Treasury Manager's operations
// =================================================

type Result = variant {
  // Represents current balances of all parties known to the Treasury Manager from its perspective.
  // Refer to the comment above `service : (TreasuryManagerArg)` for more details.
  Ok : Balances;

  // Represents all errors potentially observed during a composite operation.
  Err : vec Error;
};

type Error = record {
  code : nat64;
  message : text;
  kind : ErrorKind;
};

type ErrorKind = variant {
  // Prevents the call from being attempted.
  Precondition : record {};

  // Prevents the response from being interpreted.
  Postcondition : record {};

  // An error that occurred while calling a canister.
  Call : record {
    method : text;
    canister_id : principal;
  };

  // Backend refers to, e.g., the DEX canister that this asset manager talks to.
  Backend : record {};

  // The service is currently not available; please call back later.
  TemporarilyUnavailable : record {};

  // An exotic error that cannot be categorized using the tags above.
  Generic : record {
    generic_error_name : text;
  };
};

type Balances = record {
  timestamp_ns : nat64;
  asset_to_balances : opt vec record { Asset; BalanceBook };
};

type BalanceBook = record {
  treasury_owner : opt Balance;
  treasury_manager : opt Balance;
  external_custodian : opt Balance;
  fee_collector : opt Balance;
  payees : opt Balance;
  payers : opt Balance;

  // An account in which items are entered temporarily before allocation to the correct
  // or final account, e.g., due to transient errors.
  suspense : opt Balance;
};

type Balance = record {
  amount_decimals : nat;
  account : opt Account;

  // A human-readable name of the party that holds this balance.
  name : opt text;
};

// Part D. Audit trail
// ===================

type AuditTrail = record {
  transactions : vec Transaction;
};

// Most operations that a Treasury Manager performs are (direct or indirect) ledger transactions.
// However, for generality, any call from the Treasury Manager can be recorded in the audit trail,
// even if it is not related to any literal ledger transaction, e.g., adding a token to a DEX
// for the first time, or checking the latest ledger metadata.
type Transaction = record {
  result : TransactionResult;
  timestamp_ns : nat64;
  purpose : text;
  canister_id : principal;
  treasury_manager_operation : TreasuryManagerOperation;
};

type TransactionResult = variant {
  Ok : TransactionWitness;
  Err : Error;
};

// Most of the time, this just points to the Ledger block index. But for generality, one can
// also use this structure for representing witnesses of non-ledger transactions, e.g., from adding
// a token to a DEX for the first time.
type TransactionWitness = variant {
  // For financial audits.
  Ledger : vec Transfer;

  // For low-level debugging.
  NonLedger : text;
};

type Transfer = record {
  block_index : nat;
  amount_decimals : nat;
  ledger_canister_id : text;
  sender : opt Account;
  receiver : opt Account;
};

// Example use case in the audit trail:
//
// ```candid
// transactions = vec {
//   record {
//     treasury_manager_operation = {
//       operation = Deposit;
//       step = record {
//         index = 0;
//         is_final = false;
//       };
//     };
//     ...
//   };
//   record {
//     treasury_manager_operation = {
//       operation = Deposit;
//       step = record {
//         index = 1;
//         is_final = true;
//       };
//     };
//     ...
//   };
// };
type TreasuryManagerOperation = record {
  operation : Operation;
  step : Step;
};

type Operation = variant {
  Withdraw;
  Deposit;
  IssueReward;
  Balances;
};

type Step = record {
  index : nat64;
  is_final : bool;
};

// Parties involved in the treasury asset management process:
// 1. treasury_owner     - e.g., the SNS Governance canister.
// 2. treasury_manager   - this canister.
// 3. external_custodian - e.g., the DEX in which assets are held temporarily.
// 4. fee_collector      - takes into account all the fees incurred due to treasury_manager's work.
// 5. payees             - e.g., developer salary payments.
// 6. payers             - e.g., liquidity provider rewards.
//
// Expects flow of assets:
