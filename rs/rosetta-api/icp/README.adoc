= Rosetta API for ICP

This is a standalone server which implements the https://www.rosetta-api.org/[Rosetta API]

It allows cryptocurrency exchanges to read and write ICP transactions using a standard interface.

The Rosetta API uses slightly different terminology to us:
* Accounts are canisters on our system
* Shards are subnets
* Mempools are the ingress queue

== Building and running the Rosetta image

Enter the dev container

```
./ci/container/container-run.sh
```

Use Bazel to build the image locally:

```
$ bazel build //rs/rosetta-api/icp:rosetta_image.tar
```

Then load the image in docker

```
$ docker load -i $(bazel cquery //rs/rosetta-api/icp:rosetta_image.tar --output=files)
...
Loaded image: localhost/rosetta:image
```

Finally run the image

```
$ docker run -it localhost/rosetta:image
```

Remember to mount `/home/rosetta/log` and `/data` to persist logs and data after shutting down the docker container.
