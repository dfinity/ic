### Changed
- The dfinity/rosetta-api docker image is now based on a
  [distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless)
  container that contains only the rosetta binary and direct runtime dependencies.
  As a consequence, you will not be able to enter shell on this image.

### Added
- Support for `NEURON_INFO` operation.
- Support for `REMOVE_HOTKEY` operation.
- Support for `FOLLOW` operation.

## [1.4.0] - 2022-03-14
### Added
- Support for `MERGE_MATURITY` neuron management operation.
- Optional parameter `percentage_to_spawn` to allow partial spawning of neuron maturity with the existing `SPAWN` operation.

### Changed
- --token-name parameter renamed to --token-symbol

### Fixed
- /network/options always returns the full list of supported operations.
- Names of some neurons management operations changed to match the documentation:
  * `START_DISSOLVE` -> `START_DISSOLVING`
  * `STOP_DISSOLVE` -> `STOP_DISSOLVING`
  * `ADD_HOT_KEY` -> `ADD_HOTKEY`
- The output of /construction/submit endpoint now returns operation statuses in the metadata field as stated in the documentation.

## [1.3.0] - 2021-12-28
### Added
- /account/balance endpoint can now return information about neurons.
- Support for custom token names.
  Use -t command line argument to specify token name other than ICP.
- Support for `SPAWN` neuron management operation.

## [1.2.0] - 2021-09-28
### Added
- Support for `ADD_HOTKEY` neuron management operation.

### Changed
- Neuron address derivation is now supported by /construction/derive endpoint.
  Custom /neuron/derive endpoint is removed.
- /construction/submit endpoint now returns the list of operation statuses in metadata as described in the documentation.
  If there was a TRANSACTION operation in the list, the submit result will contain the hash of the corresponding ledger transfer.
  Otherwise, if all the actions are neuron-management actions, the transaction hash is all zero hash.
- "sqlite" is the default storage type now.
  Other storage types are deprecated.
- Block synchronization speed is significantly improved (~10x).
- /transaction/search endpoint now supports returning multiple transactions if the search criteria is empty.
  This enables clients to display the list of recent transactions in an efficient way.

- Documentation for fund staking and neuron management (see `rosetta-api/docs`).
- Support for neuron management operations:
  * `SET_DISSOLVE_TIMESTAMP`
  * `START_DISSOLVING`
  * `STOP_DISSOLVING`

### Changed
- Neuron address is now supposed to be derived using a custom `/neuron/derive` endpoint.
  This is a temporary experimental feature, the next release won't contain this endpoint.

## [1.0.5] - 2021-07-22
### Added
- Support for fund staking (`STAKE` operation).
- Support for neuron address derivation.
- Sqlite storage backend.

### Changed

### Added
- Original release.
