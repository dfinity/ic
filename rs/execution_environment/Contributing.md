Management Canister API Contribution Guideline
====

The following steps outline the recommended approach to introduce a new Management Canister API or change an existing one:

1. Specify the new API or make the required changes to an existing one in the *Interface Specification* in the [portal](https://github.com/dfinity/portal) repository:
   - typically, you would want to make changes in the [following file](https://github.com/dfinity/portal/blob/master/docs/references/ic-interface-spec.md);
   - additionally, make sure you update the [Candid interface](https://github.com/dfinity/portal/blob/master/docs/references/_attachments/ic.did) of the Management Canister accordingly;
   - furthermore, make sure to provide motivation for the new API or changes you're making and how it would benefit the ICP protocol.

2. The public Management Canister [types](https://crates.io/crates/ic-management-canister-types) need to be updated. Inform *@eng-sdk* of the work required.

3. The [Rust CDK](https://github.com/dfinity/cdk-rs) needs to be updated. Inform *@eng-sdk* of the work required.

4. [Motoko](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko) needs to be updated. Inform *@eng-motoko* of the work required.

5. Add any new types or update existing ones in `types/management_canister_types`. If possible, stick to existing naming conventions. E.g., error variants tend to have a domain specific prefix and a clear suffix describing the error, e.g., `ErrorCode::CanisterNotFound`. 

6. Implement the new API in the `execution_environment` crate. Main parts that need to be updated are:
   - the core implementation in the `canister_manager` module;
   - wiring up the new API in `ExecutionEnvironment` to expose it externally.

   Make sure to implement robust input validation and think of various (security-relevant) edge cases.

   Note: Some management methods (e.g., `install_code` and `install_chunked_code`) include dedicated logic to handle rollback after failures. However, for the majority of methods, there should be a clearly defined point during execution at which changes become permanent and rollback is no longer possible. Specifically:
   - no changes are performed before that point (only `&self` access to the state);
   - no failure can happen after that point (the execution is guaranteed to succeed and return a reply).

7. Write tests to cover the new or updated functionality:
   - Use the `ExecutionTest` framework by default.
   - Use the `StateMachine` framework if the feature involves inter-canister calls, canister HTTPS outcalls, threshold signatures, or checkpointing. These require mocked Consensus layer outputs or a full state manager.

8. Once the *Interface Specification* change has been agreed on, the public Management Canister [types](https://crates.io/crates/ic-management-canister-types), [Motoko](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko), and [Rust CDK](https://github.com/dfinity/cdk-rs) can be updated to use the new API on a feature branch. Coordinate with *@eng-sdk* and *@eng-motoko* as needed.

9. Once the implementation is rolled out fully on mainnet, the Interface Specification, public Management Canister types, Rust CDK, and Motoko changes can be merged to master.
