= Archive Canister cycles consumption by operation type

Here are presented the results of cycles cunsumption measures on an archive canister. The calls are made using the ledger canister method get_transaction. +
To setup the measures, 10 transactions of each type (mint, burn and transfer) are stored in the archive canister. +
e.g. 0:9 are mint, 10-19 are burn and 20-29 are transfers. +
[Note] The plots of the first table are the result of 100 calls. +

[Note] Each cycles measure is the average of 10 calls on a local replica setup. +
