= ICRC-1 Ledger on a Local Replica

This guide will show you how to setup a local replica with a running Ledger that implements the  https://github.com/dfinity/icrc-1[ICRC-1 Fungible Token Standard].

== Step 0: Preparations

Before you start, make sure you have DFX. If you don’t have DFX installed, follow instructions on https://internetcomputer.org/[internetcomputer.org] to install it. While not necessary, you should work in an empty directory. Use the following commands to work in an empty repository: 

[,console]
----
$ mkdir icrc1_ledger_test
$ cd icrc1_ledger_test
----

== Step 1: Download the Ledger

​The DFINITY Foundation publishes both the source code and the artefacts of its ICRC-1 Ledger. For this guide we are going to use the Ledger published with following commit of the Internet Computer repository. Note that the IC_VERSION used here is only examplatory, developers are encouraged to use the latest version built. 

[,console]
----
$ export IC_VERSION=ca8847547d327ce8a3bd81d25a590e01da1a3af5
----

Download the ledger wasm and its candid file and unzip the ledger wasm

[,console]
----
$ curl -o ic-icrc1-ledger.wasm.gz https://download.dfinity.systems/ic/${IC_VERSION}/canisters/ic-icrc1-ledger.wasm.gz
$ curl -o ledger.did https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/ic/${IC_VERSION}/rs/ledger_suite/icrc1/ledger/ledger.did
$ gunzip ic-icrc1-ledger.wasm.gz
----

The directory you are currently in should now look like something like the following. 
Note that your specific data size may vary depending on the IC_VERSION you are using. 

[,console]
----
$ ls -sh1 *       

1.4M ic-icrc1-ledger.wasm
3.5K ledger.did
----

== Step 2: Start the replica

​Create the file *​dfx.json*​ ,

[,console]
----
$ touch dfx.json
$ nano dfx.json
----

insert the following information.

[,json]
----
{
    "canisters": {
      "icrc1-ledger": {
        "type": "custom",
        "wasm": "ic-icrc1-ledger.wasm",
        "candid": "ledger.did"
      }
    },
    "networks": {
        "local": {
        "bind": "127.0.0.1:8003"
      }
  }
  }
----

Save and exit *dfx.json*.

​Then start the replica

[,console]
----
$ dfx start --background
----

Make sure the port specified in *dfx.json* under _"networks":..._ is available. Otherwise, you may want to change the port in *dfx.json* or free up the port on your machine. 

Before we can deploy the Ledger we need to get the principal that will be used as both minting account and controller of the archive canisters. For a local setup we are going to use the principal of the current identity.
Store the principal of the current identity inside an environment variable

[,console]
----
$ export PRINCIPAL=$(dfx identity get-principal)
----

​Now you can deploy the Ledger


[,console]
----
$ dfx deploy icrc1-ledger --argument "(record {
  token_symbol = \"TEX\";
  token_name = \"Token example\";
  minting_account = record { owner = principal \"$PRINCIPAL\"  };
  transfer_fee = 10_000;
  metadata = vec {};
  initial_balances = vec {};
  archive_options = record {
    num_blocks_to_archive = 2000;
    trigger_threshold = 1000;
    controller_id = principal \"$PRINCIPAL\";
  };
},)"
----


== ​Step 3: Mint some tokens

It's finally time to mint some tokens! Let's mint 1_000_000 tokens to the principal akllx-q5q7v-sgdck-cjd7y-izqql-ck5rp-ee3c7-kzrea-k3fnf-pcuaw-pqe. 

[,console]
----
$ dfx canister call icrc1-ledger icrc1_transfer '(record {
  to = record {owner = principal "akllx-q5q7v-sgdck-cjd7y-izqql-ck5rp-ee3c7-kzrea-k3fnf-pcuaw-pqe"};
  amount=1_000_000
},)'
----

and check the balance

[,console]
----
$ dfx canister call icrc1-ledger icrc1_balance_of '(record { owner=principal "akllx-q5q7v-sgdck-cjd7y-izqql-ck5rp-ee3c7-kzrea-k3fnf-pcuaw-pqe" },)'

(1_000_000 : nat64)
----

== Conclusion 

In this guide we have seen how to setup a local replica with an ICRC-1 Ledger installed and ready to be used.
