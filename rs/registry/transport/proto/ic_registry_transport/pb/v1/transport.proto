// Set of messages used to interact with the registry canister.
//
// The registry canister implements the following three methods:
//
// get_latest_version(RegistryGetLatestVersionRequest) ->
// RegistryGetLatestVersionResponse
//
// get_value(RegistryGetValueRequest) -> RegistryGetValueResponse
//
// atomic_mutate(RegistryAtomicMutateRequest) -> RegistryAtomicMutateResponse
//
// get_latest_version() returns the latest version of the registry, i.e. the
// version of the last update made to the registry.
//
// get_value() returns the a value for specified version of a specified key from
// the registry, or the latest version if a version was not specified.
// get_value() returns a RegistryError if the key was not present.
//
// atomic_mutate() inserts, updates or deletes a set of keys in the registry.
// Mutations are atomic, meaning either all mutations are applied, or none
// are applied.
//
// Note that registry versions are always strictly >= 0, a -1 value is used
// to signal that no version was assigned.
//
// # Migrating to Large Values/High-Capacity Types
//
// Clients need to migrate if they fetch `CatchUpPackageContents`(s) via one (or
// more) of the following methods:
//
//     1. get_certified_changes_since
//     2. get_value
//     3. get_changes_since
//
// (Such entries have keys of the form `catch_up_package_contents_${subnet_id}`.)
//
// Many types here have corresponding "high-capacity" types. E.g. we define both
// RegistryValue and HighCapacityRegistryValue. We refer to the former as the
// "legacy" type; whereas, we call the later the "high-capacity" type. We are
// transitioning to the high-capacity types. Although clients need to do some
// work, the migration will be "nice and gradual". This section explains what
// clients can and must do, and when.
//
// The key observation is that as long as
//
//     1. the `large_value_chunk_keys` field is not populated, and
//     2. whenever `deletion_marker` is true, `value` is empty
//
// then, it is possible to convert from a high-capacity object to a equivalent
// legacy object by encoding, and then decoding. Furthermore, the other
// direction also works. This allows a window during which clients can start
// using high-capacity types at any time.
//
// Once the high-capacity type definitions are in the master branch of the ic
// GitHub repo, the migration window has "opened". An announcement will be sent
// shortly after this event. This will occur as soon as possible to give clients
// as much time as possible to migrate.
//
// At this point, client CAN migrate. That is, they can (develop and) deploy
// versions of their application that use high-capacity types instead of legacy
// types. Once they do that, they will be ready for the Registry canister to
// start emiting large data.
//
// During this time, Registry will also migrate to high-capacity types, but will
// not actually start emitting large data right away.
//
// After clients have had a "reasonable" amount of time to migrate, large data
// will start appearing in Registry. At that point, the migration window is
// "closed", and clients will need to have migrated. An announcement will be
// sent shortly before this event. The appearance of large data might be delayed
// if clients need more time to migrate.
//
// After the migration window, the legacy types will be obsolete. Therefore, it
// will be a bit silly for "HighCapacity" to be in the name of the types, and it
// will be confusing for the legacy types to be retained. Therefore, what will
// happen shortly after the migration window is that the legacy type definitions
// will be replaced/modified with a copy of the high-capacity type definitions.
// After a "long" time has passed, the "HighCapacity" names will go away.
//
// To ease this secondary/cleanup transition (where "HighCapacity" is deleted),
// it is recommended that clients create some aliases. E.g. in Rust,
//
// ```rust
// use ic_registry_transport::pb::v1::{
//     HighCapacityRegistryValue as RegistryValue,
// };
// ```
//
// Then, when the legacy definitions are replaced, clients can change the above
// line to this:
//
// ```rust
// use ic_registry_transport::pb::v1::{
//     RegistryValue,
// };
// ```
//
// Once all clients have made such changes, it will be possible to delete
// "HighCapacity" definitions from this file. (Ofc, such clean up is not
// strictly necessary, and can easily be deferred for a long time.)
//
// TODO(NNS1-3679): Delete this section once all the steps here are completed.
