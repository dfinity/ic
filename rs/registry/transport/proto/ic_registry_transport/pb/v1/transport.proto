// Set of messages used to interact with the registry canister.
//
// The registry canister implements the following three methods:
//
// get_latest_version(RegistryGetLatestVersionRequest) ->
// RegistryGetLatestVersionResponse
//
// get_value(RegistryGetValueRequest) -> RegistryGetValueResponse
//
// atomic_mutate(RegistryAtomicMutateRequest) -> RegistryAtomicMutateResponse
//
// get_latest_version() returns the latest version of the registry, i.e. the
// version of the last update made to the registry.
//
// get_value() returns the a value for specified version of a specified key from
// the registry, or the latest version if a version was not specified.
// get_value() returns a RegistryError if the key was not present.
//
// atomic_mutate() inserts, updates or deletes a set of keys in the registry.
// Mutations are atomic, meaning either all mutations are applied, or none
// are applied.
//
// Note that registry versions are always strictly >= 0, a -1 value is used
// to signal that no version was assigned.
