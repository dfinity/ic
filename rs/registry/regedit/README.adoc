= ic-regedit: Registry (Local Store) EDitor

(in homage to `ed(1)`).

== Goal(s)

The *primary goal* is to provide a CLI-tool for operators (in testing, subnet
recovery, etc.) of IC nodes to quickly inspect a given version of the registry
local store using a human readable format.

The *secondary goal* is to provide the ability to manipulate the registry local
store.

This document should give an overview of how the tool is supposed to be used.
Please check the `help`-information printed by the tool itself to get detailed
(and up-to-date) information

== Snapshot

Using the `snapshot`-command, you can produce a (normalized) snapshot in the
form of a json object that is printed on stdout. To make the output readable
while still retaining uniqueness, all binary arrays are abbreviated and/or
replaced with a human-readable string. For example, a snapshot of the latest
version of the registry stored at `/path/to/ic_registry_local_store` can be
produced as follows:

----
$ ic-regedit snapshot /path/to/ic_registry_local_store
{
  "__version": 2,
  "blessed_replica_versions": {
    "blessed_version_ids": [
      "0.8.0"
    ]
  },
  "catch_up_package_contents_bi6cn-uevgq-pnqwc-6bmx7-plgau-qezww-kqnwd-h7eqk-xejb5-fq2t4-eae": {
    "height": 0,
    "initial_ni_dkg_transcript_high_threshold": {
      "committee": [
        "(principal-id)tzile-f666x-w4k7f-iztlm-euq5q-w4y7w-p4n7i-l4od3-swige-tgunn-pqe"
      ],
<< snip >>
----

The tool lends itself to be used in conjunction with other tools that further
process the output, such as `jq`.

=== Normalization

As mentioned above, any json-structure that is produced by `ic-regedit` is normalized.
In particular, any non-empty byte array whose length is equal or less than 29
bytes is parsed as a principal id and represented as a string. Example:
`"(principal-id)tzile-f666x-w4k7f-iztlm-euq5q-w4y7w-p4n7i-l4od3-swige-tgunn-pqe"`.

Byte arrays that are larger than 32 bytes are hashed in order to compress the
output. Example:

`"(binary-data|sha256)B45A2A3A5F72C7618CCB08BEBAF909EB21AD3267327D817558085AED4BA63AAD"`

Empty byte arrays and byte arrays of lengths between 29 and 31 bytes are
represented as their respective hex value. Example:
`"(binary-data)8276050F1BE07CDF9F957867C2B48FA7B7358BE0C8A7F9728A66F6A0FE3FD9BA"`

The type of a value is defined by its corresponding key(-prefix). For example,
at the time of writing, any key starting with `node_record_` corresponds to an
object of message-type `NodeRecord`.

If `ic-regedit` can't recognize the type of a key, its value is simply interpreted as
a byte array and normalized as described above.

==== Caveats and current limitations (Read!)

*Protobuf Decoding*: Registry Values are stored as protobuf values. As a result,
the object structure of each individual value is defined by the _version of
ic-regedit_. In particular, if the underlying protobuf message definitions changed and
new fields where added, an outdated version of `ic-regedit` will not display the new
fields. This is particularly important when applying changes to the registry
(see below).

*Binary data type mismatch*: The way `ic-regedit` works internally is that the
protobuf objects are first translated to a universal Json-object tree. In a next
step, the tree is traversed and the normalization (as described above) is
applied. As principal ids are currently directly embedded as byte arrays in
many places, the coarse-grained normalization approach might end up translating
short arrays to principal ids even though they are not.

At the time of writing, all valid fields of type `bytes` in the registry do
either contain a principal id, are empty, or do contain data that is longer than
31 bytes (e.g. a hash, a certificate, a public key, etc.). As a result, as of
now, this is not a problem. However, in the future, in case short byte arrays
are added, those will be encoded as principal ids and the resulting snapshot
cannot be read back in (see below).

== Applying an Update

Using `ic-regedit` it is possible to update the registry by editing the snapshot file.
A typical workflow would probably look like this:

First dump the current registry version:

----
$ ic-regedit snapshot /path/to/ic_registry_local_store > snapshot.json
----

Then edit the snapshot in place.

Binary data can be encoded using the representations discussed above
(`(dinary-data)...`, etc.). Hash values serve as stand-ins for the actual value,
i.e., when reading the snapshot back in, `ic-regedit` will replace the hashed value
with the original value again.

----
$ vim snapshot.json # or jq, etc.
----

Before you apply the update, you might want to make sure you know what will
change. You can do this by calling the `show-diff` command. Let's say e.g. we
took the example registry from above and the only change that we applied is that
we added a version `0.9.0` to the list of blessed replica versions. The output
should look like this:

----
$ ic-regedit show-diff /path/to/ic_registry_local_store snapshot.json
{
  "__version": 3,
  "blessed_replica_versions": {
    "blessed_version_ids": [
      "0.8.0", "0.9.0"
    ]
  }
}
----

The version in the diff is the version that registry is supposed to be _updated
to_. For convenience, if the version in the snapshot that is passed in matches
the latest version of the registry, it is assumed that this constitutes an
update to latest version and the target version is thus the next version. In the
example above, the registry would be updated to version 3.

Keys that were removed from the snapshot are marked with a field value of
`"(deleted)"`. For example:

`"crypto_record_tzile-f666x-w4k7f-iztlm-euq5q-w4y7w-p4n7i-l4od3-swige-tgunn-pqe_1": "(deleted)"`

Note that changes are tracked on the levels of keys. Thus, even if you only
change a field of a value, the entire value will be shown here (and set in the
registry).

Actually applying the change is done using the `apply-update` command:

----
$ ic-regedit apply-update /path/to/ic_registry_local_store snapshot.json
----

If the command exits successfully, you can check the effect again by diff'ing
changed snapshot against a newly created one. Since the new snapshot should now
reflect the changes you made in the first snapshot, the only difference you
should see is in the version field:

----
$ ic-regedit snapshot /path/to/ic_registry_local_store > snapshot2.json
$ diff snapshot.json snapshot2.json
2c2
<   "__version": 2,
---
>   "__version": 3,
----

=== Amend

It is also possible to "amend" the latest version, i.e., change the latest
version in-situ. However, this is *not* recommended as the registry is
fundamentally an append-only versioned key-value store.

=== Asking for a specific version

Each snapshot carries a field `__version` which contains the registry version at
which the snapshot was taken. This field is ignored when applying an update, but
check against the latest version. If the latest version of the local store to be
updated does not match the version specified in the snapshot, the update will
fail. While it is not recommended to use `ic-regedit` to make changes on a running
node, it is thus ensured that no inconsistencies can arries because of
incompatible versions.

It is possible to ask for a specific version. Just apply the `--version` option
to the `snapshot` command. For example, the following command produces a
registry snapshot at version 23, provided it exists:

----
$ ic-regedit snapshot --version 23 /path/to/ic_registry_local_store
...
----

The provided version can also be _negative_. In this case the value is relative
to the latest version. For example, if you want to show the diff between the
second latest and the latest version, you could do the following (using the
example from above): 

----
$ ic-regedit snapshot /path/to/ic_registry_local_store > latest.json
$ ic-regedit show-diff --version -1 /path/to/ic_registry_local_store latest.json
{
  "__version": 3,
  "blessed_replica_versions": {
    "blessed_version_ids": [
      "0.8.0",
      "0.9.0"
    ]
  }
}
