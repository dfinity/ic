# Next Upgrade Proposal

## Added

* `cooling_down` field in `SubnetRecord`, settable via `UpdateSubnetRecord` proposals. See
  `ic_replicated_state::SubnetTopology::cooling_down` for the exact semantics. The field must not
  be set on mainnet before the replica version rejecting ingress messages to cooling down subnets
  has been rolled out to all subnets.
