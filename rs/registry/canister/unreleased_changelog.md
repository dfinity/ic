# How This File Is Used

In general, upcoming/unreleased behavior changes are described here. For details

# Next Upgrade Proposal

## Added

* Added a new endpoint `set_default_initial_dkg_subnet` to the registry
  canister, which sets (or removes, if `subnet_id` is `null`) the registry key
  `default_initial_dkg_subnet_id`. When set, `SetupInitialDKG` management
  canister calls that do not specify a subnet id explicitly are routed to the
  configured subnet instead of the calling subnet (NNS).
* Added `vcpu_type` to `GuestLaunchMeasurementMetadata` to record the virtual CPU type used for a guest launch measurement.

## Changed

* **SEV on existing subnets:** Reverted — `sev_enabled` can once again only be set at subnet creation;
  any update_subnet proposal that would change the effective `sev_enabled` value (in either direction,
  including via wholesale `features` replacement with `sev_enabled` left unset) is rejected.
